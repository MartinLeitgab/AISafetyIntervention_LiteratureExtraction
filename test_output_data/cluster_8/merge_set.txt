Step 2: Confirm that no substantial distinctions would be lost\u2014 all four nodes support the single argumentative claim that AI energy needs can diverge greatly from brain energy. Step 3: Evaluate graph impact\u2014merging removes redundancy and centralises edges about AI-energy feasibility without harming specificity because the details are complementary facets of the same concept. Therefore, merge 279, 280, 281, and 282.",

Architectural differences, the use of higher-level representations, and specialised hardware can yield orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, meaning AI systems may match or surpass human cognition at far lower (or potentially higher) power levels. Consequently, dismissing AI viability on the basis of brain-energy constraints is unwarranted."
