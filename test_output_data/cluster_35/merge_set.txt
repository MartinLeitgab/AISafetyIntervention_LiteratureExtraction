The narrower mechanism is a core component of the broader method; their informational content is highly redundant.\nStep 3: Confirm no critical distinctions would be lost \u2013 the only extra element in Node 942 (target networks, human-in-loop context) can be preserved in an aggregated description. No separate downstream edge semantics are jeopardised.\nStep 4: Conclude they can be safely compressed into one supernode covering \u201cexperience-replay-based off-policy Q-learning for sample efficiency\u201d.",

The combination significantly improves sample efficiency, making it practical to learn from limited human-in-the-loop interactions."
