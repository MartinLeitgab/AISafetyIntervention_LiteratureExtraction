Node 279 states the (often-incorrect) premise that AI must match brain-level power usage; Node 282 directly rebuts this premise; Nodes 280 and 281 supply the two major mechanistic reasons (architectural abstraction and specialised hardware) that explain why the premise fails. Because these nodes jointly describe one coherent concept \u2014 \u2018why brain-energy constraints do not determine AI energy feasibility\u2019 \u2014 keeping them separate would fragment the same claim into four highly overlapping micro-nodes. No important sub-distinctions would be lost by merging, while graph simplicity and queryability improve.",

AI systems can employ higher-level representations, algorithmic abstractions, and specialised hardware accelerators that reduce energy per useful operation by orders of magnitude, so the energy needed for human-level or superhuman cognition is not tightly linked to brain metabolism."

Node 1034 notes the standard RL objective omits any term for observation cost, and Node 1035 specifies that, in RLHF, human-provided labels constitute a dominant cost component. They describe two facets of exactly the same overarching concept \u2014 \u2018reward acquisition is expensive and should be modelled\u2019. Merging avoids redundancy without obscuring nuance, because the supernode can capture both the general oversight and its concrete manifestation in human-feedback settings.",
