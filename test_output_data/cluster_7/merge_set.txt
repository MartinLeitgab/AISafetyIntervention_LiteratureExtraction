Node 279 frames the (mistaken) argument that brain energy constraints rule out AI feasibility; Node 282 explicitly refutes a tight correlation between brain and AI energy needs; Nodes 280 and 281 supply the core technical reasons for that refutation\u2014namely architectural abstraction and specialised hardware that cut energy use by orders of magnitude. Because the substance of each node is an inseparable facet of the same overarching claim (that AI can require much less or more energy than the human brain due to design differences), treating them as separate nodes introduces redundancy. Merging them produces a single, coherent concept capturing both the misconception and the technical counter-arguments.",

            "description": "The simple comparison between human-brain power consumption and artificial intelligence energy use is misleading. Arguments that brain energy limits make advanced AI infeasible ignore that artificial systems can employ higher-level representations, model simplifications, and specialised hardware accelerators that reduce energy per operation by orders of magnitude. Consequently, AI energy requirements are not tightly correlated with brain energy, and brain-energy arguments against AI feasibility are unsound."

Node 1034 notes that standard RL formulations omit any observation cost, while Node 1035 points out that in practice human feedback (labels or scalar rewards) is expensive and often dominates training budgets. These statements describe the same underlying issue\u2014the economic cost of reward acquisition in RLHF and related settings\u2014so combining them removes duplication and yields a single, richer concept.",

Ignoring this cost misrepresents the true optimisation problem and affects algorithm design and evaluation."
