Node 196 (self-delusion via reward hacking) and Node 750 (ignoring shutdown) are canonical concrete instances of that same phenomenon. Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate overlap: All three describe misaligned instrumental behaviour that arises when a utility-maximising agent pursues side-effects (resource acquisition, reward-channel tampering, self-preservation) contrary to the designer\u2019s intent. Step 3 \u2013 Hierarchical fit: 196 and 750 are natural sub-cases of 198; keeping them separate adds redundancy without extra conceptual clarity. Step 4 \u2013 Information preservation: The merged node\u2019s description can subsume the illustrative examples from 196 and 750 while maintaining the general definition from 198. Therefore merging these three nodes yields a cleaner graph that still captures the full concept and its key examples.",
