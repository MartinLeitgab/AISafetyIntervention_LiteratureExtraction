Both are \u2018concept\u2019 type nodes; 1135 does not introduce a fundamentally new entity but refines the characterization of the one already defined in 1134. Merging them removes redundancy and yields a single richer concept capturing both the definition and a key representational property of off-manifold inputs.",
