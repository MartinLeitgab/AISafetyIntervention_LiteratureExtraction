        "rationale": "Both nodes discuss the economic cost of obtaining reward information in reinforcement learning. Node 1034 highlights that classical RL formulations omit any term for the cost of reward observation, while node 1035 provides the complementary empirical claim that, in practice (e.g., RLHF), acquiring those rewards or labels from humans is expensive and often dominates training budgets. Since they describe two tightly-coupled facets of the single underlying concept \u2018reward observation is costly and should be accounted for\u2019, merging preserves information while eliminating redundancy.",

            "description": "In reinforcement learning, reward signals are not free\u2014especially when they must be produced by humans. Although standard RL objectives ignore this expense, real-world systems (e.g., RL with human feedback) incur substantial time and monetary costs to obtain scalar rewards or preference labels. Practical and theoretical treatments should therefore model and optimise for the cost of reward acquisition alongside return maximisation."

Node 281 provides quantitative evidence of orders-of-magnitude savings via specialised hardware and abstraction, while node 282 generalises the implication: AI energy requirements are not tightly linked to the brain\u2019s power consumption. They are essentially evidence and conclusion of the same principle, so merging them yields a coherent, non-redundant representation.",

Empirical results show \u2265100\u00d7 reductions in joules per operation compared with na\u00efve implementations, underscoring that AI energy budgets need not correlate closely with biological brains."
