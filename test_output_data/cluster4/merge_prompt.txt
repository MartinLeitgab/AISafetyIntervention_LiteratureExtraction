# AI Safety Knowledge Graph Semantic Compression
You are an expert in AI safety knowledge graph compression. Given the following nodes and their relationships, your task is to:
1. Only consider merging the primary nodes listed below. Do NOT merge or suggest merging any neighbor nodes.
2. Decide which primary nodes should be merged into a single supernode (merged concept).
3. Provide a clear rationale for each merge decision. Reason step by step
4. For each merge set, generate merged parameters for the supernode: name, description, type, and any other relevant attributes.

5. Reason step by step for each merge decision to ensure the highest quality rationale.

Consider only these nodes for merging: [196, 1133, 1134, 1137, 1135, 943, 1136]

Nodes:
Node ID: 196
Name: self-delusion due to reward hacking
Type: concept
Description: Agents directly modify their sensory channel or reward source to falsely maximise observed reward

Node ID: 943
Name: ignoring user suggestions degrades human input quality
Type: concept
Description: Consistently overriding a human’s suggested controls reduces their ability to provide meaningful inputs in real-time tasks.

Node ID: 1133
Name: adversarial input perturbations cause misclassification
Type: concept
Description: Small, often imperceptible, input changes crafted by an attacker that make the model output the wrong class.

Node ID: 1134
Name: inputs located off the training-data manifold
Type: concept
Description: Data points that lie in low-density regions of the true data distribution learned during training.

Node ID: 1135
Name: off-manifold directions easier to identify in deeper hidden representations
Type: concept
Description: Because representation manifolds become flatter with depth, deviations from the manifold are more separable in hidden layers.

Node ID: 1136
Name: DAE reconstruction vector approximates gradient of log density
Type: concept
Description: For small corruption noise, the difference r(x)-x scales with ∇log p(x), aligning the reconstruction direction with the data manifold.

Node ID: 1137
Name: insert denoising autoencoder modules into selected hidden layers
Type: intervention
Description: Replace or augment specific hidden layers with a denoising autoencoder that adds Gaussian noise and outputs a denoised activation; trained jointly with classification and reconstruction objectives.
