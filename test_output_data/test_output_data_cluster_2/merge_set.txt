Both nodes describe inseparable facets of the same practical challenge: achieving high policy performance with as few expensive human queries as possible. They are the same conceptual grain-size (both are problems/requirements in reward learning) and share the same node type (concept). Keeping them separate would fragment a single idea into cost statement vs. solution requirement without adding useful graph structure.",

Together they form a single, coherent concept: understanding and detecting off-manifold/adversarial inputs via representation depth and denoising-autoencoder gradients.
