(3) Semantically they form one coherent concept: a critique of the \u201cbrain-energy feasibility\u201d argument. (4) None of the remaining primary nodes overlap in subject matter (they cover reward-costs, non-stationarity, staged architectures, etc.), so merging outside this quartet would reduce clarity.
