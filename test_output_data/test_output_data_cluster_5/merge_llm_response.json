(2) Node 1035 states the empirical fact that human labelling dominates the budget; Node 1036 states the consequent objective of reducing the number of queries while preserving task performance; Node 1037 formalises this situation as an Active RL (ARL) MDP with a per-query cost c; Node 1038 diagnoses a specific failure mode (standard exploration ⇒ zero queries) that arises within that very ARL framework. (3) These points are mutually reinforcing facets of one conceptual cluster rather than independent concepts; they are rarely referenced in isolation in AI-safety literature. (4) No semantic conflict exists among them, and merging will not lose granularity needed elsewhere because any downstream edge can still target the merged super-concept. (5) The other primary nodes (197, 279, 753) deal with unrelated themes—model-based utility definition, energy-based feasibility arguments, and shutdown-related utility bounds—so merging them with this set would introduce conceptual incoherence. Therefore, merging 1035-1038 into a single supernode maximally compresses the graph without information loss.\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"name\": \"Active Reinforcement Learning with Costly Human Feedback\",\n        \"type\": \"concept\",\n        \"description\": \"In reinforcement learning from human feedback, obtaining reward labels is expensive in time and money. The active RL framework extends the standard MDP by letting the agent decide whether to query a human for each state–action and subtracting a fixed cost c when it does. Effective agents must minimise the number of costly queries while still exploring and learning; naïve exploration heuristics can backfire, leading to zero querying and poor performance. This concept covers the empirical cost issue, the formal ARL model, optimisation strategies for query selection, and known failure modes.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","refusal":null,"role":"assistant","annotations":[],"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1758235577,"model":"o3-2025-04-16","object":"chat.completion","service_tier":"default","system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":1295,"prompt_tokens":627,"total_tokens":1922,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":832,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"audio_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":0}}}
