Node 280 supplies one mechanism for the rebuttal\u2014AI can operate on higher-level representations rather than neuron-level simulation.\n4. Node 281 supplies a second mechanism\u2014specialised hardware and abstraction deliver orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains.\nTaken together they form a single, coherent concept: \u2018AI energy requirements can be far above or below those of the brain because of architectural and hardware flexibility.\u2019  Merging removes redundancy and lets downstream reasoning treat the misconception, counter-argument, and evidence as one consolidated idea.",

Architectural freedom, higher-level representations, and specialised hardware can make AI systems require orders of magnitude more or less power than the brain; therefore dismissing AI feasibility on brain-energy grounds is unfounded."
