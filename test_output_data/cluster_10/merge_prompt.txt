# AI Safety Knowledge Graph Semantic Compression
You are an expert in AI safety knowledge graph compression. Given the following nodes and their relationships, your task is to:
1. Only consider merging the primary nodes listed below. Do NOT merge or suggest merging any neighbor nodes.
2. Decide which primary nodes should be merged into a single supernode (merged concept).
3. Provide a clear rationale for each merge decision. Reason step by step
4. For each merge set, generate merged parameters for the supernode: name, description, type, and any other relevant attributes.

5. Reason step by step for each merge decision to ensure the highest quality rationale.

Consider only these nodes for merging: [364, 200, 279, 282, 280, 1034, 1035, 281, 104]

Nodes:
Node ID: 104
Name: nonstationary_behavior_distribution
Type: concept
Description: Because the agent’s policy changes during learning, the distribution over visited states and actions drifts over time.

Node ID: 200
Name: staged AI architecture
Type: intervention
Description: Phase 1 passive model learner; Phase 2 boxed self-model learner with forced exploration; Phase 3 active deployment agent

Node ID: 279
Name: reliance on brain-energy constraint to dismiss AI feasibility
Type: concept
Description: The assumption that human-brain energy requirements imply prohibitive power needs for artificial intelligence.

Node ID: 280
Name: AI architectures can differ from brain and use higher-level representations
Type: concept
Description: Artificial systems are not constrained to neuron-level simulation and can operate on compressed higher-level data structures.

Node ID: 281
Name: specialised hardware and abstraction reduce energy per operation by orders of magnitude
Type: concept
Description: Empirical evidence shows dedicated accelerators and model simplifications yield ≥100× energy savings compared to naïve implementations.

Node ID: 282
Name: energy requirements of AI not tightly correlated with brain energy
Type: concept
Description: Because of architectural and hardware differences, AI could match or surpass human cognition at far lower or higher power levels.

Node ID: 364
Name: Nuclear-norm β-quantile recovery algorithm
Type: concept
Description: An optimisation that maximises alignment with observed ratings while constraining entries, row sums and nuclear norm to extract a β-quantile matrix.

Node ID: 1034
Name: standard RL ignores reward observation cost
Type: concept
Description: In conventional reinforcement learning the agent observes rewards for free, so the optimisation objective contains no term for the cost of acquiring those rewards.

Node ID: 1035
Name: human feedback labelling cost is significant in reward learning
Type: concept
Description: Obtaining scalar rewards or preference labels from humans during training requires time and money, often dominating the training budget in RLHF settings.
