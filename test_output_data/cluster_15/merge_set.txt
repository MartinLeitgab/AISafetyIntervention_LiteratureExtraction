        "rationale": "Both nodes describe the same technical idea: improving sample-efficiency in off-policy Deep Q-learning by using a large experience-replay buffer and related stabilisation tricks (target networks / NFQI). Node 103 is a concrete instantiation (uniform sampling from a 1 M transition buffer), while node 942 is a more general statement of the same intervention in a human-in-the-loop setting. No important, orthogonal information would be lost by combining them; instead, the merged node removes redundancy and cleanly unifies the method and its motivation.",
