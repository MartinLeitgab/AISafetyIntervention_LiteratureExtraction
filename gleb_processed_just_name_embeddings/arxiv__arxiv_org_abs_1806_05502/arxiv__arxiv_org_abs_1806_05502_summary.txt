Summary  
This paper introduces “neural stethoscopes” – small probe networks whose loss is weighted (λ) and back-propagated to any hidden layer of a main model – as a general mechanism to (i) analyse what information is present in internal representations (λ = 0, analytic), (ii) promote complementary information (λ > 0, auxiliary) or (iii) suppress harmful, bias-inducing information (λ < 0, adversarial).  
Using a new ShapeStacks variant for predicting block-tower stability, the authors show that networks latch onto the spurious correlation between “local stability” (a purely visual cue) and the true target “global stability”. Auxiliary stethoscopes that predict the origin of instability improve performance on hard test cases, while adversarial stethoscopes trained on local-stability labels successfully de-bias the model, raising accuracy on previously misclassified towers. Analytic stethoscopes also reveal where in the network each type of information is linearly accessible.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
The fabric captures all explicit causal–interventional paths from the identified top-level risk (spurious cue reliance) through problem analysis, theoretical insights, design rationale, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence and the three actionable interventions. All nodes are interconnected, no orphan nodes remain, and naming follows the required granularity rules.  

Inference strategy justification  
Only minor inference was required: assigning intervention lifecycle stages and maturity levels (marked as Experimental because results are from single-paper studies on synthetic data). Edges reflect explicit statements or quantitative results; confidence values are reduced where links are primarily conceptual.  

Extraction completeness explanation  
Every distinct claim that participates in the reasoning chain (15 nodes) has been extracted. All three modes of the stethoscope (analytic, auxiliary, adversarial) are decomposed, and both positive and negative experimental findings are reflected in the validation evidence nodes.  

Key limitations  
• Quantitative improvements reported in figures are approximate (exact numbers not given).  
• The paper studies a single physical domain; generalisation to other tasks is presumed but untested, so maturity is kept low.  
• Edge confidence scoring is necessarily subjective where the paper offers qualitative rather than statistical evidence.
