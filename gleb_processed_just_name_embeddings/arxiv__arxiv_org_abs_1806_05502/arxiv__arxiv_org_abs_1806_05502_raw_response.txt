          "text": "Summary  \nThis paper introduces “neural stethoscopes” – small probe networks whose loss is weighted (λ) and back-propagated to any hidden layer of a main model – as a general mechanism to (i) analyse what information is present in internal representations (λ = 0, analytic), (ii) promote complementary information (λ > 0, auxiliary) or (iii) suppress harmful, bias-inducing information (λ < 0, adversarial).  \nUsing a new ShapeStacks variant for predicting block-tower stability, the authors show that networks latch onto the spurious correlation between “local stability” (a purely visual cue) and the true target “global stability”. Auxiliary stethoscopes that predict the origin of instability improve performance on hard test cases, while adversarial stethoscopes trained on local-stability labels successfully de-bias the model, raising accuracy on previously misclassified towers. Analytic stethoscopes also reveal where in the network each type of information is linearly accessible.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  \nThe fabric captures all explicit causal–interventional paths from the identified top-level risk (spurious cue reliance) through problem analysis, theoretical insights, design rationale, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence and the three actionable interventions. All nodes are interconnected, no orphan nodes remain, and naming follows the required granularity rules.  \n\nInference strategy justification  \nOnly minor inference was required: assigning intervention lifecycle stages and maturity levels (marked as Experimental because results are from single-paper studies on synthetic data). Edges reflect explicit statements or quantitative results; confidence values are reduced where links are primarily conceptual.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nEvery distinct claim that participates in the reasoning chain (15 nodes) has been extracted. All three modes of the stethoscope (analytic, auxiliary, adversarial) are decomposed, and both positive and negative experimental findings are reflected in the validation evidence nodes.  \n\nKey limitations  \n• Quantitative improvements reported in figures are approximate (exact numbers not given).  \n• The paper studies a single physical domain; generalisation to other tasks is presumed but untested, so maturity is kept low.  \n• Edge confidence scoring is necessarily subjective where the paper offers qualitative rather than statistical evidence.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Spurious visual cue reliance in global stability prediction models\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Visual shortcut bias in stability prediction\", \"Local-cue dependence in block-tower physics models\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"End-to-end vision models trained to predict whether a block tower will fall often exploit simple local visual cues that correlate with labels in the training set instead of reasoning about centre-of-mass physics, causing systematic failures when the correlation is absent.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Highlighted in 'Local Stability as a Visual Cue' where error rate jumps on hard scenarios, showing risk of shortcut reliance.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Correlation between local and global stability labels in training data for block towers\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Training data bias linking local and global stability\", \"Positive correlation of local and global stability in easy scenarios\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"In the easy subset of the ShapeStacks dataset, towers with globally unstable configurations almost always exhibit a local instability at the same interface, creating a strong statistical cue that models can memorise instead of learning physical rules.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Discussed in 'Dataset' and evidenced in Figure 3 where networks trained on the biased split fail on the hard, anti-correlated split.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Gradient-weighted supplemental tasks modulate feature extraction in neural networks\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Auxiliary/adversarial loss shaping representations\", \"Supplemental task influence via λ weighting\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Adding a loss on a secondary task to hidden activations with positive (auxiliary) or negative (adversarial) weight steers the encoder toward or away from features that are predictive of that task, thereby controlling what information is present.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Formalised in equations (2)–(4) in section 'Neural Stethoscopes'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Neural stethoscope framework for promoting or suppressing task-specific information in hidden layers\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Stethoscope design rationale\", \"Unified analytic-auxiliary-adversarial probing\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"A probe network attached to any layer provides an independent loss that can (i) analyse representations (λ=0), (ii) encourage complementary information (λ>0) or (iii) suppress nuisance factors (λ<0) without changing the main architecture.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"design rationale\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Motivated in 'Neural Stethoscopes' introduction and Figure 1.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Auxiliary stethoscope training on instability origin features (λ>0)\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"λ-positive stethoscope for origin prediction\", \"Complementary information promotion mechanism\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"A two-layer perceptron attached to the penultimate layer predicts which block interface will initiate collapse;
