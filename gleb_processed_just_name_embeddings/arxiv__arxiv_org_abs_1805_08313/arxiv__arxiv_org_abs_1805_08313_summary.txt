Summary
Data source overview:  
The paper presents a robust-policy learning framework for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents when reward functions are misspecified.  By representing the unknown reward as a linear combination of features and defining the set of reward weights consistent with expert demonstrations, the authors cast safety as a two-player max-min game.  They provide (1) an exact but heavy ellipsoid-method algorithm and (2) a practical Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) algorithm – both with provable guarantees – and empirically validate the approach in Gridworld and Cart-Pole.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
– The fabric captures every logically distinct step from the top-level risk (negative side effects) through problem analysis, theoretical insight, design rationale, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence, and actionable interventions.  
– Node naming follows the granularity conventions and should merge cleanly across sources.  
– All nodes are interconnected; no isolation or direct risk→intervention links exist.  
– Minor judgement calls (e.g. mapping ‘combining multiple experts’ as a design rationale) required moderate inference (edge confidence 2), reflected in confidence scores.

Inference strategy justification  
Where the paper only implies an intervention (e.g. “construct the consistent reward polytope from multiple experts”), light inference transformed it into an explicit actionable step, marked with edge-confidence 2.  All other links rely on explicit algorithmic descriptions, theorems, or experiments.

Extraction completeness explanation  
15 nodes (~15 / 5000 words) capture every core causal-interventional pathway: misspecification risk → incomplete rewards → max-min formulation → design rationales → three concrete algorithmic mechanisms → four strands of theoretical/empirical validation → three interventions.

Key limitations  
1. The paper’s proofs are validation for algorithmic soundness, not for real-world deployment; maturity values are therefore capped at Prototype (3).  
2. Experimental evidence is limited to toy domains; transferability remains uncertain.  
3. Mapping “construct reward polytope” to an intervention may overlap with design in other sources; consistent naming rules should mitigate merge errors.
