Summary  
This paper analyses conditions under which generally-intelligent agents that can rewrite their own policy or utility function will (or will not) perform dangerous self-modifications.  It defines three styles of value functions (hedonistic, ignorant, realistic) and proves (Theorems 14–16) that only the “realistic” formulation provably eliminates incentives for goal-destroying self-modifications.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
The paper presents clear formal causal chains and the extracted fabric follows them.  Structure and naming follow the specified patterns and the JSON has been syntactically validated.  To improve future extractions the instructions could clarify how to represent purely mathematical proofs as “validation evidence” (currently inferred as type=validation evidence) and whether multiple validation nodes for different negative findings are preferred or should be merged.

Inference strategy justification  
Intervention nodes (“Implement realistic value functions…”, “Exclude hedonistic/ignorant value functions…”) are not stated as deployment steps in the text, but follow directly from the authors’ safety recommendations in Conclusions.  They are therefore marked lifecycle 1, maturity 1 and edge_confidence 2.

Extraction completeness  
All reasoning chains from the top-level risk (unsafe self-modification) through problem analyses (value-function pathologies) to the mathematically validated remedy (realistic value functions) are included, along with negative evidence that strengthens the motivation to avoid faulty value functions.

Key limitations  
• The paper assumes perfect knowledge of self-modification consequences; practical implementation mechanisms may need additional nodes (e.g., learning these consequences).  
• Proofs are theoretical; no empirical validation exists, limiting maturity classification.
