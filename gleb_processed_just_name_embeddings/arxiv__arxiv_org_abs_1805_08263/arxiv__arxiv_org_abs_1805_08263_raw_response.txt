          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper proposes a framework in which an autonomous agent operating in a partially-observed, potentially hazardous environment must decide both how to act and what information to transmit to a remote human partner. It introduces an information-theoretic human-preference model based on weighted entropy reduction, a practical determinize-and-replan algorithm for information selection, and an online learning algorithm that infers human weights and scoring function. Experiments in a 2-D mining and a 3-D fetching task validate the approach.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]\nThe node/edge fabric follows the required causal-interventional flow, every node is connected, naming granularity is consistent, and JSON syntax has been sanity-checked. Remaining uncertainty (17 %) stems from interpreting AI-safety-relevant risks that are implicit rather than explicit.\n\nInference strategy justification: Moderate inference (confidence ≤ 3) was applied only to make the AI-safety risk explicit and to generalise interventions from the presented algorithms.\n\nExtraction completeness: All reasoning steps—risk, lack-of-model problem, weighted-entropy insight, two-tier objective, algorithms, experimental validation, and resulting interventions—are captured with no isolated nodes.\n\nKey limitations: (i) The source does not report large-scale field deployment; maturity levels are therefore provisional. (ii) Only two interventions were extractable; future work might split them further once more deployment evidence appears.\n\nJSON Knowledge Fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\":
