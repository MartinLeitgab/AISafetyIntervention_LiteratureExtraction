          "text": "Data source overview  \nThe provided excerpt (section “2 Algorithm and Intuition”) presents Algorithm 1, a convex‐optimization procedure that recovers a β-quantile matrix M from a noisy rating matrix Â coming from n raters over m items, assuming only an α-fraction of raters are reliable. The algorithm maximises ⟨Â,M⟩ while enforcing element-wise bounds, a β-quantile sparsity constraint and a nuclear-norm bound that exploits an assumed low-rank structure, and it provides a theoretical error tolerance ε.\n\nReport EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[42]  \nThe extraction is necessarily speculative because the excerpt is short and contains no empirical sections, so moderate inference was required to: (1) map the algorithm to an AI-safety-relevant risk (robust aggregation of human feedback) and (2) define an intervention that embeds the algorithm inside RLHF pipelines. The JSON passes the mandatory structural checks, but future full-paper access could alter node granularity or add validation evidence, hence 42 / 100.\n\nHow the instruction set could be improved  \n1. Permit marking “limited source scope” so downstream systems know large inference jumps were unavoidable.  \n2. Provide example edge verbs for Problem → Theoretical Insight transitions (“addressed_by”, “explained_by”) because “caused_by” often feels semantically wrong there.  \n3. Allow citing line numbers when section titles are absent in small excerpts.\n\nInference strategy justification  \n• Used direct statements for optimisation objective and constraints (high confidence).  \n• Inferred the safety relevance (robust feedback aggregation) and the RLHF lifecycle stage (moderate confidence).  \n• Inferred maturity as “experimental” because only theoretical guarantees are shown.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nEvery explicit reasoning element in the excerpt (unreliable raters → optimisation idea → algorithm → theoretical guarantee) is captured, all interconnected, and one practical intervention is derived to close the path. No concepts were left unconnected.\n\nKey limitations  \n• No empirical results were available, so validation evidence is purely theoretical.  \n• Broader context (full problem formulation, proofs, experiments) is missing; additional nodes may be needed once available.  \n• The RLHF framing is an inferred application, not stated in the text.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Inaccurate item quality estimation in rating-based learning systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"incorrect ranking due to unreliable ratings\", \"misestimated quantile in crowdsourced data\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"When a learning system relies on user-supplied ratings to estimate which items belong in the top β-quantile, unreliable data can lead to systematically wrong quality estimates, harming downstream decision-making.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Represents the top-level risk the algorithm aims to alleviate (section “2 AlgorithmandIntuition”).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Adversarial or noisy raters in crowdsourced rating data\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"unreliable fraction of raters\", \"malicious or low-quality ratings\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Only an α-fraction of raters are assumed to be reliable;
