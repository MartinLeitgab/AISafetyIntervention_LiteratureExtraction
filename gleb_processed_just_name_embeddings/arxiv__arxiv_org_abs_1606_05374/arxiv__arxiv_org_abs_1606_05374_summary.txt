Data source overview  
The provided excerpt (section “2 Algorithm and Intuition”) presents Algorithm 1, a convex‐optimization procedure that recovers a β-quantile matrix M from a noisy rating matrix Â coming from n raters over m items, assuming only an α-fraction of raters are reliable. The algorithm maximises ⟨Â,M⟩ while enforcing element-wise bounds, a β-quantile sparsity constraint and a nuclear-norm bound that exploits an assumed low-rank structure, and it provides a theoretical error tolerance ε.

Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[42]  
The extraction is necessarily speculative because the excerpt is short and contains no empirical sections, so moderate inference was required to: (1) map the algorithm to an AI-safety-relevant risk (robust aggregation of human feedback) and (2) define an intervention that embeds the algorithm inside RLHF pipelines. The JSON passes the mandatory structural checks, but future full-paper access could alter node granularity or add validation evidence, hence 42 / 100.

How the instruction set could be improved  
1. Permit marking “limited source scope” so downstream systems know large inference jumps were unavoidable.  
2. Provide example edge verbs for Problem → Theoretical Insight transitions (“addressed_by”, “explained_by”) because “caused_by” often feels semantically wrong there.  
3. Allow citing line numbers when section titles are absent in small excerpts.

Inference strategy justification  
• Used direct statements for optimisation objective and constraints (high confidence).  
• Inferred the safety relevance (robust feedback aggregation) and the RLHF lifecycle stage (moderate confidence).  
• Inferred maturity as “experimental” because only theoretical guarantees are shown.

Extraction completeness explanation  
Every explicit reasoning element in the excerpt (unreliable raters → optimisation idea → algorithm → theoretical guarantee) is captured, all interconnected, and one practical intervention is derived to close the path. No concepts were left unconnected.

Key limitations  
• No empirical results were available, so validation evidence is purely theoretical.  
• Broader context (full problem formulation, proofs, experiments) is missing; additional nodes may be needed once available.  
• The RLHF framing is an inferred application, not stated in the text.
