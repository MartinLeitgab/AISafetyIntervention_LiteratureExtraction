Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces Xception, an ImageNet-scale vision architecture that replaces Inception modules with depth-wise separable convolutions and adds residual skip connections. Large-scale experiments on ImageNet and Google’s JFT dataset show higher accuracy with virtually identical parameter count, faster convergence when residuals are used, and further gains when no activation is inserted between depth-wise and point-wise operations.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[92] – High confidence that all causal–interventional paths from architecture-level risks (computational inefficiency, optimisation instability) to concrete design interventions (separable convolutions, residual connections, activation removal) are exhaustively captured.  
Instruction-set improvement: Allow an explicit “derived_from” or “exacerbated_by” edge to express that a secondary risk emerges after an initial design choice; would reduce the need to re-use “caused_by” for that purpose.  
Inference strategy justification: Only light inference (confidence 2) was used to connect optimisation risks back to the core separable-convolution mechanism; all other links are directly supported by the paper’s text and figures.  
Extraction completeness explanation: Every distinct claim used in reasoning (15 concept nodes) and every actionable architectural change (3 intervention nodes) is represented; all nodes are connected through 20 edges, satisfying the fabric requirements.  
Key limitations: Paper does not cover security or alignment-specific hazards; extracted interventions focus on efficiency/optimisation aspects that indirectly matter for safety (e.g. energy use, reliability). Results were obtained on vision tasks only, so generalisability is uncertain.



Key verification checklist:  
✔ No edge connects risk directly to an intervention.  
✔ All reasoning paths interlink via the common implementation mechanism node, creating a single connected fabric.  
✔ Every node appears in at least one edge; no duplicates or satellites.  
✔ Framework (Xception) is decomposed into separable components: separable convs, residuals, activation choice.  
✔ JSON syntax validated; node names exactly match edge references.
