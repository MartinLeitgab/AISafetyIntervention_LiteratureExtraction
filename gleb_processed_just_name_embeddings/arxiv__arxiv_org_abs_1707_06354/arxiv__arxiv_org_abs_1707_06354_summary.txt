Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces a practical solution to the value-alignment problem in human-robot collaboration. Building on Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL), it models humans as noisily-rational, pedagogic teachers and robots as pragmatic listeners, derives a pragmatic-pedagogic fixed-point that reduces the game to a POMDP, and validates the approach in a simulated meal-preparation task where success rises from 15 % (literal IRL robot) to 86 % (pragmatic CIRL robot).

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  
Inference strategy justification: Only light, well-grounded inferences were applied when the paper implied but did not explicitly label AI-safety-relevant interventions (e.g., training robots with the derived policy). All other nodes are explicit in the text.  
Extraction completeness explanation: Every causal-interventional pathway from the two top-level risks identified (objective misalignment and physical-coordination injury) to the single actionable intervention is captured through interconnected concept nodes that mirror the paper’s logical flow. All framework components (pedagogy, pragmatics, Boltzmann belief updates, Stackelberg structure, POMDP value iteration) are decomposed into white-box nodes. No isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) The validation evidence is simulation-only, so maturity estimates may be optimistic. 2) The paper focuses on a narrow manipulation domain, so generalisation across tasks is inferred, not demonstrated. 3) Edge confidences rely on qualitative judgment where quantitative statistics are absent.

Improvements to instruction set: Clarifying whether edges such as ‘enabled_by’ versus ‘motivates’ are preferred for concept-to-concept transitions would reduce ambiguity. Providing concrete examples of connecting multiple risks into a single intervention path would help ensure all risks are adequately bridged without disallowed direct edges from risks to interventions.
