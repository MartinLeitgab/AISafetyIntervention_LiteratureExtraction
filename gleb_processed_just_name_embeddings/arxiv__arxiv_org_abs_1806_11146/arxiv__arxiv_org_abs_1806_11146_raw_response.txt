Six ImageNet classifiers are re-programmed to count squares, classify MNIST and classify CIFAR-10 with up to 99 % accuracy, showing that (1) standard adversarial-training defenses fail, (2) random-weight networks are far less vulnerable, and (3) non-linear, learned representations enable the attack.  Potential harms include theft of cloud compute and repurposing AI assistants for malicious behaviour.\n\nExtraction confidence [83]  \nInference strategy justification:  The paper proposes no concrete defenses, so three safety-relevant interventions were moderately inferred (confidence 1-2 edges) from the attack analysis and security discussion (§5.3).  All other nodes/edges are grounded in explicit sections (§3–§5).  \nExtraction completeness explanation:  Twenty nodes capture all causal–interventional reasoning steps from root risk → mechanisms → empirical findings → proposed (or inferred) mitigations, with full cross-linking; every empirical claim needed to justify any edge is included as a validation-evidence node.  \nKey limitations:  • Defensive evidence is speculative because the source contains none. • Only image-domain attacks covered; cross-domain generalisation is implicit. • Edge confidence may shift when further empirical work on defenses appears.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Unauthorized adversarial reprogramming of neural networks in deployed systems\",\n

Explicitly clarify whether speculative validation nodes (confidence 1) are acceptable when the paper lacks defence evidence; this extraction assumed they are needed to satisfy the mandatory full-path template.\n2. Provide an example showing how to handle multiple design rationales branching from the same validation evidence to reduce ambiguity in edge directions.\n3. Include a short list of allowed moderate-inference node types so extractors know when creating speculative nodes is preferred over omitting the category."
