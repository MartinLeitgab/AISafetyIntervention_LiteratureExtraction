Summary
Data source overview:  
The paper introduces “adversarial re-programming”: an attacker learns an additive, input-wide perturbation (“adversarial program”) that hijacks a trained neural network to perform a completely new task.  Six ImageNet classifiers are re-programmed to count squares, classify MNIST and classify CIFAR-10 with up to 99 % accuracy, showing that (1) standard adversarial-training defenses fail, (2) random-weight networks are far less vulnerable, and (3) non-linear, learned representations enable the attack.  Potential harms include theft of cloud compute and repurposing AI assistants for malicious behaviour.

Extraction confidence [83]  
Inference strategy justification:  The paper proposes no concrete defenses, so three safety-relevant interventions were moderately inferred (confidence 1-2 edges) from the attack analysis and security discussion (§5.3).  All other nodes/edges are grounded in explicit sections (§3–§5).  
Extraction completeness explanation:  Twenty nodes capture all causal–interventional reasoning steps from root risk → mechanisms → empirical findings → proposed (or inferred) mitigations, with full cross-linking; every empirical claim needed to justify any edge is included as a validation-evidence node.  
Key limitations:  • Defensive evidence is speculative because the source contains none. • Only image-domain attacks covered; cross-domain generalisation is implicit. • Edge confidence may shift when further empirical work on defenses appears.

Improvements to instruction set
1. Explicitly clarify whether speculative validation nodes (confidence 1) are acceptable when the paper lacks defence evidence; this extraction assumed they are needed to satisfy the mandatory full-path template.
2. Provide an example showing how to handle multiple design rationales branching from the same validation evidence to reduce ambiguity in edge directions.
3. Include a short list of allowed moderate-inference node types so extractors know when creating speculative nodes is preferred over omitting the category.
