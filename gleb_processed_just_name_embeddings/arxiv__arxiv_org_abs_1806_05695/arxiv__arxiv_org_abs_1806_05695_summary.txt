Summary
Data source overview:  
The paper presents the first study of using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) to evolve Atari-game agents directly from raw pixels. While CGP attains competitive or even human-level scores on some games, the authors highlight three shortcomings: (i) evolution often converges to simple, repetitive “reward–hacking’’ strategies that fail to use pixel input, (ii) these local optima arise because the evolutionary fitness equals the total episodic reward, (iii) evaluating whole episodes for every individual is computationally expensive. In the Discussion section the authors propose three future-work interventions: add novelty metrics, apply frame-level/priority-based reward shaping, and reduce the number of evaluated frames.

Extraction-confidence statement: EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: Where the paper only sketches an idea (e.g. novelty metrics), moderate inference was used to convert it into implementable AI-safety-relevant interventions; these edges are assigned confidence 2.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps linking the top-level risk (“sub-optimal generalisation”) to each of the three proposed solution families are captured through the six concept categories, with no isolated nodes.  
Key limitations: The paper contains no quantitative validation of the proposed fixes; therefore several validation-evidence nodes rely on citations or author discussion rather than new experiments.

Improvements to instruction set: The current instructions require six concept categories in strict order, which works for linear arguments but forces creation of placeholder nodes when papers omit certain layers (e.g. explicit validation). Allowing optional omission of concept layers—while still enforcing connectedness—would reduce speculative node creation. Additionally, providing a canonical mapping of common AI-safety terms to node categories would improve naming consistency across 500 k sources.
