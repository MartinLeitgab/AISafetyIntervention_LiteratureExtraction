          "text": "Summary\nData source overview:  \nThe paper presents the first study of using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) to evolve Atari-game agents directly from raw pixels. While CGP attains competitive or even human-level scores on some games, the authors highlight three shortcomings: (i) evolution often converges to simple, repetitive “reward–hacking’’ strategies that fail to use pixel input, (ii) these local optima arise because the evolutionary fitness equals the total episodic reward, (iii) evaluating whole episodes for every individual is computationally expensive. In the Discussion section the authors propose three future-work interventions: add novelty metrics, apply frame-level/priority-based reward shaping, and reduce the number of evaluated frames.\n\nExtraction-confidence statement: EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  \nInference strategy justification: Where the paper only sketches an idea (e.g. novelty metrics), moderate inference was used to convert it into implementable AI-safety-relevant interventions; these edges are assigned confidence 2.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps linking the top-level risk (“sub-optimal generalisation”) to each of the three proposed solution families are captured through the six concept categories, with no isolated nodes.  \nKey limitations: The paper contains no quantitative validation of the proposed fixes; therefore several validation-evidence nodes rely on citations or author discussion rather than new experiments.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Suboptimal policy generalization in CGP-evolved Atari agents\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"brittle strategies in CGP Atari\", \"lack of generalization in CGP controllers\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"CGP agents often settle on simple behaviours that score well on training games but do not use pixel input robustly, limiting transferability and interpretability.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Discussion §5 highlights that many evolved agents crouch–punch or hide in corners, showing limited game understanding and thus poor generalization.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Episodic reward-based fitness selection in CGP evolution\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"whole episode reward selection pressure\", \"average score as fitness\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Fitness is the cumulative score over an entire game episode;

Allowing optional omission of concept layers—while still enforcing connectedness—would reduce speculative node creation. Additionally, providing a canonical mapping of common AI-safety terms to node categories would improve naming consistency across 500 k sources.\n\n"
