Summary  
Data source overview:  
The paper introduces “DeepGame”, a two-player game-based, Lipschitz-grounded verification framework that delivers anytime upper- and lower-bounds on point-wise robustness of deep neural networks (maximum safe radius and feature robustness). It shows how Monte-Carlo Tree Search, Admissible A* and Alpha-Beta pruning can be composed with feature-based input partitioning to scale verification to modern image models, and validates the technique on MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB and Nexar traffic-light data, outperforming several state-of-the-art attack methods.

Extraction confidence[86]  
Inference strategy justification: Only explicit statements from the paper were converted into nodes; light inference (edge confidence 2) was used solely to connect high-level interventions that the paper clearly motivates but does not operationalise.  
Extraction completeness: All causal chains from the central risk (adversarial misclassification) through theoretical insight, design, implementation, validation and the four actionable AI-safety interventions are captured and interconnected; no isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) The paper focuses on vision models; transfer to NLP is inferred but un-validated. 2) Reported empirical evidence is limited to small-/mid-scale datasets. 3) Interventions relating to training-time regularisation were not explicit and hence excluded.
