          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper introduces Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML), a family of meta-learning regularisation techniques that avoid biasing the initial model toward the particular tasks encountered during meta-training. Two complementary approaches are proposed: (1) entropy-based regularisation that maximises prediction entropy before adaptation (and/or minimises it after), and (2) inequality-measure regularisation that explicitly minimises inequality in task losses (Theil, Gini, GE, Atkinson, VL). Experiments on Omniglot, Mini-Imagenet and a 2-D navigation reinforcement-learning task show consistent improvements over MAML, Meta-SGD and other baselines.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  \nInference strategy justification: All nodes map directly to clearly delineated sections (“2 Approach”, “2.1.1 Entropy-Maximisation/Reduction TAML”, “2.1.2 Inequality-Minimisation TAML”, “4 Experiments”) and follow the mandated category flow. Only moderate inference was required to assign intervention lifecycle (pre-training) and maturity (experimental).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning step—from the top-level risk (poor generalisation) through mechanism (biased initial model), causal insight (lack of task-agnostic prior), design rationales (entropy and inequality regularisation), concrete implementations, empirical validation, to the actionable interventions—is captured. Branches for the two TAML paradigms converge on the same core risk, forming an integrated fabric with no isolated nodes.  \nKey limitations: 1) Validation evidence relies on benchmark accuracy improvements rather than formal safety metrics. 2) Paper does not detail deployment ramifications; lifecycle assignment therefore stops at pre-training. 3) Confidence scores are heuristic and may require recalibration across larger corpora.\n\nHow to improve instruction set: Allow explicit representation of “shared” nodes (e.g. identical risk or problem nodes) across many sources, possibly via node-level unique identifiers or ontology references; clarify whether “design rationale” to “implementation mechanism” should always use “implemented_by” or if “enabled_by” is acceptable; provide examples for regularisation techniques to aid consistent naming.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Poor generalization of meta-learned models to unseen tasks\",\n
