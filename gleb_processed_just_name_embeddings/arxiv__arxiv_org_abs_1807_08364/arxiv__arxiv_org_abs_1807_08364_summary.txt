Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces EnsembleDAgger, a Bayesian extension of the DAgger imitation-learning algorithm. By estimating the novice policy’s epistemic uncertainty with a deep‐ensemble approximation of a Gaussian Process, EnsembleDAgger gates novice actions using both (1) action discrepancy from the expert and (2) the novice’s variance (“doubt”), thereby aiming to maximise novice autonomy while tightly constraining failure probability. Experiments on an inverted pendulum and MuJoCo HalfCheetah show lower failure rates and faster learning than Vanilla- and SafeDAgger.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  
Inference strategy justification: Only modest inference was required (e.g., mapping “doubt rule” to “deep ensemble variance estimation” as an implementation mechanism) and was flagged with confidence 2 edges.  
Extraction completeness: All causal–interventional pathways from the central risk (“failure-state reachability”) to the actionable interventions (“apply EnsembleDAgger …” and “train deep ensemble …”) are represented through the mandated node categories. Nodes are named for cross-source mergeability, every node participates in at least one edge, and no intervention is linked directly to a risk.  
Key limitations: (1) Results are still experimental (maturity 2); (2) safety guarantees rely on assumptions that familiarity correlates with risk; (3) thresholds ξ, ψ need tuning—future work could inform additional intervention nodes once tuning heuristics are formalised.

Key verification checklist  
✅ No direct edges connect risk and intervention nodes.  
✅ All nodes participate in at least one edge; no duplicates or isolates.  
✅ Framework (EnsembleDAgger) decomposed into component nodes (decision rule + ensemble mechanism).  
✅ Node names follow prescribed granularity for cross-source mergeability.  
✅ JSON structure validated for field presence and exact node name references.
