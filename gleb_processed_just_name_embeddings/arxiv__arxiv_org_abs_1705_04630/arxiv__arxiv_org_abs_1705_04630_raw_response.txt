It does so by (i) representing only those environment properties that are “simple enough” as convex sets of probability distributions (“incomplete models”) and (ii) constructing a dominant-forecaster, formalised as a combinatorial prediction market that guarantees convergence to every incomplete model in a countable collection.  \nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83].  \nInference–strategy justification: The paper is purely theoretical, so interventions had to be inferred (marked confidence-2 edges) by translating the existence proofs into plausible AI-safety engineering steps.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps linking the core risk (forecast unreliability) to actionable mitigation (building a dominant-forecaster module) are covered through 10 interconnected nodes; no node is isolated.  \nKey limitations: 1) The intervention is non-constructive in the paper, so maturity is necessarily “foundational”. 2) Empirical validation is limited to illustrative examples, not large-scale experiments.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Unreliable long-term forecasts in complex environments\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"forecast failure for complex environments\", \"long-horizon prediction unreliability\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Standard machine-learning forecasters often become inaccurate or vacuous when the real environment is more complex than their hypothesis class, undermining safe decision-making over long time horizons.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced in Section 1 Introduction as the motivating risk for developing new forecasting methods.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Limitations of realizable and unrealizable forecasting assumptions\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"realizable setting unrealistic\", \"short-term guarantees in unrealizable setting\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"The realizable setting assumes the true distribution lies in the model class—often false.

Provide explicit examples of edge verbs for each consecutive node category to avoid ambiguity (e.g. theoretical→design should usually be “operationalised_by”).  \n2. Include a short glossary mapping mathematical proof as acceptable “validation evidence” to reduce doubts when no empirical data are present.  \n3. Clarify how many distinct interventions should be inferred when the source is purely theoretical."
