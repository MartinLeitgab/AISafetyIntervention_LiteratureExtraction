          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper “Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality” introduces the Skip-gram family of techniques (negative sampling, hierarchical softmax, subsampling and phrase-token training) that yield fast, accurate word and phrase embeddings. The authors provide theoretical justifications, concrete algorithmic designs, and empirical validation on analogy benchmarks and training-time measurements.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – The resulting fabric captures every causal-interventional chain discussed (three risks, six problem analyses / insights, full set of design/implementation mechanisms, three validated interventions) and inter-connects them through shared Skip-gram components. JSON was lint-checked for key/edge consistency.  \nInstruction-set improvement: Allow an explicit “shared node” tag so extractors can denote that the same real-world mechanism is reused in multiple reasoning chains without duplicating edge definitions.  \n\nInference strategy justification: Top-level “risks” had to be inferred (semantic failure, compute cost, idiomatic phrase loss) because the paper is performance-oriented, not safety-oriented; confidence on those edges is therefore marked lower (2-3). All other edges are directly supported by the paper’s algorithmic description and empirical tables (confidence 4).  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All core methods (Skip-gram, negative sampling, hierarchical softmax, subsampling, phrase detection) and their empirical findings (analogy accuracy, speedups) are represented. No isolated nodes remain, and all interventions are downstream-visible.  \n\nKey limitations: 1) Real safety relevance is indirect; nodes rely on moderate inference to phrase performance problems as “risks”. 2) Validation evidence is limited to the paper’s own experiments; no external replication is encoded. 3) The paper does not break down implementation hyper-parameters exhaustively; only the major tunings cited are extracted.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Semantic misunderstanding in NLP applications due to poor embeddings\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"inaccurate
