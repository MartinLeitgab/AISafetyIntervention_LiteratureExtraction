Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces a system that combines CNN feature embeddings, the DEMUD incremental-SVD novelty detector, and an up-convolutional (UC) visualizer to discover novel images in very large datasets and automatically generate human-comprehensible “expected vs novel” visual explanations. Experiments on balanced and unbalanced ImageNet subsets and on Mars-rover imagery show large gains in discovery performance and interpretability compared with pixel or SIFT representations.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
Inference strategy justification: Only concepts explicitly argued or quantitatively demonstrated in the paper were extracted. Future-work claims (e.g., fine-tuning on target domains) were retained as low-maturity, inference-flagged interventions because the authors directly motivate them.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All statements forming causal chains from the top-level risk (missing scientific anomalies) through mechanisms, theoretical insights, design steps, concrete implementations, empirical validation, and actionable interventions were captured. Nodes were split to the granularity required for seamless deduplication across 500 k sources. No isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: The paper is not written for AI-existential-risk contexts, so safety relevance is indirect; some intervention naming therefore required light inference (confidence 2). Performance statistics are drawn from small benchmarks, limiting edge confidence to 3–4 rather than 5.
