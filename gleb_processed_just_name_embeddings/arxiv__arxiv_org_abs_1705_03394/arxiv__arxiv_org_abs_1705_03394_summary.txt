Summary  
Data source overview: The paper presents the “aestivation hypothesis” as a solution to the Fermi paradox.  It argues that technologically mature civilisations rationally expand, secure resources and then hibernate until the cosmic background temperature falls, because each joule then yields ~10³⁰-fold more irreversible computation.  The authors analyse (i) the thermodynamics of very-far-future computation, (ii) cosmological processes that deplete usable matter/energy, (iii) the civilisational coordination required to protect resources over trillions of years, and (iv) possible megascale engineering to minimise resource loss.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
Inference strategy justification:  All core causal–interventional chains in the paper flow from three top-level risks (premature resource loss, cosmological resource dissipation, and external predation during hibernation).  Each chain was decomposed into the mandated six concept categories and ends in explicit or lightly-inferred interventions.  Where interventions were not literally labelled as such in the text (e.g. “seed dust in protostellar clouds”), light inference is marked and given edge confidence 2.  
Extraction completeness:  23 connected nodes (~1 per 600 words) cover every distinct claim, mechanism, finding and proposal pivotal to the authors’ reasoning, and all nodes are mutually connected through shared design-rationale “Civilisation-wide hibernation …”, forming a single knowledge fabric.  
Key limitations:  (1) Empirical evidence is entirely theoretical, so confidence values are ≤3.  (2) Interventions operate at astrophysical, not conventional AI-lab, scale; transfer to AI-safety contexts is therefore speculative.  (3) The paper’s very long time-horizon assumptions are uncertain; downstream analyses should treat maturity/lifecycle classifications cautiously.  

Suggested prompt improvements  
• When sources are speculative, allow “theoretical projection” as an explicit evidence-strength label to distinguish from empirical medium evidence.  
• Provide a short canonical list of acceptable problem-analysis verbs to ease consistency across 500 k sources.  
• Clarify whether multiple risk sub-graphs must merge through shared nodes or whether separate connected components are permissible if they belong to the same document.
