Summary  
Data-source overview: The 2016 paper “Concrete Problems in AI Safety” surveys five concrete technical risks—negative side-effects, reward hacking, scalable-oversight failure, unsafe exploration and robustness to distributional shift—and sketches families of algorithmic counter-measures plus toy-experiment designs. The text contains no quantitative results, but it gives clear causal chains from each risk to candidate mitigation ideas.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83] – The text is largely conceptual, so node and edge confidence is moderate, but mapping to the requested fabric is straightforward and all checklist items were re-verified.

Inference-strategy justification: Where the paper only proposes experiments, I created low-maturity intervention nodes and assigned edge-confidence 2 (weak) to mark reasonable inference. All other links follow explicit prose.

Extraction completeness: 36 interconnected nodes reconstruct every causal–interventional chain the paper describes, including a super-risk node that links the five sub-risks into one connected fabric, satisfying node connectivity and pathway coverage goals.

Key limitations  
1. Validation evidence nodes are speculative because no empirical results are reported.  
2. Granularity may still split if future sources adopt slightly different naming.  
3. Only the dominant mitigation idea per risk is included to keep the graph readable; minor variants are omitted.

How the instruction set could be improved: 1) Provide explicit guidance on connecting multiple independent risk pathways into one connected fabric—current rules require connectedness but do not specify strategies (e.g. super-risk nodes, cross-category edges). 2) Clarify preferred edge direction for “refined_by” and other less common verbs to avoid ambiguity. 3) Supply examples on assigning edge confidences when the source only proposes experiments.
