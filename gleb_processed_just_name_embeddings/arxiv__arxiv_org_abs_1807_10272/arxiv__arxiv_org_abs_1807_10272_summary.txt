Summary  
The paper evaluates the “Adversarial Logit Pairing” (ALP) defense for ImageNet classifiers and shows it provides almost no robustness to adversarial examples when subjected to stronger, white-box projected-gradient-descent (PGD) attacks. The authors dissect why ALP fails (objective deviates from robust optimisation, uses only targeted adversarial examples, etc.), visualise its loss landscape, and demonstrate that 98.6 % of attacks succeed (0.6 % accuracy) at ε = 16/255. They recommend the stronger evaluation protocol itself as a more reliable defence-development practice.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84]  
– High confidence that all causal-interventional pathways in the paper are represented.  
– Moderate uncertainty stems from inferring an “adopt robust optimisation–based training” intervention that the authors hint at but do not experimentally validate.  
Improvement suggestion: Supply explicit mapping examples for papers whose main contribution is negative/evaluative so it is clearer how to treat “evaluation-method improvements” as interventions.

Inference strategy justification  
• Where the paper only critiques ALP but does not train an alternative, I modestly inferred the natural intervention “adopt robust optimisation-based untargeted adversarial training” (maturity = 2, confidence = 2) because the paper’s theoretical analysis directly motivates it.  
• All other nodes are directly evidenced.

Extraction completeness explanation  
Thirteen nodes capture every distinct claim, mechanism, finding or intervention that participates in any causal chain from the primary risk (adversarial misclassification) to actionable changes (stronger evaluation, robust-optimisation training). All nodes inter-connect into a single fabric; no duplicates or orphans remain.

Key limitations  
• The paper does not experimentally validate the alternative training objective, so its associated edges are lower confidence.  
• Focus is image-classification specific; generalisation to other modalities is outside the source scope.
