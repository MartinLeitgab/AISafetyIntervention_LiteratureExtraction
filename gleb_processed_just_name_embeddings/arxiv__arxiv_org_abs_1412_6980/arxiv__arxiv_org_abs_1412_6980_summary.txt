Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces Adam, an adaptive-moment first–order stochastic-gradient optimiser. It analyses the causes of optimisation instability on noisy, sparse, high-dimensional objectives, proposes bias-corrected adaptive moment estimation, derives convergence guarantees, presents empirical results on logistic regression, MLPs and CNNs, extends the method with AdaMax and temporal parameter averaging, and positions Adam versus AdaGrad and RMSProp.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84] – high because the paper has clear, explicit causal chains; remaining uncertainty lies in moderate inference for the temporal-averaging extension and safety-domain mapping.  

Inference strategy justification: Only modest inference was applied where the paper hints at, but does not empirically validate, temporal averaging and AdaMax; these edges are given low confidence (2). All other edges are grounded in explicit theoretical or experimental sections.  

Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains from the top-level risk (unstable/inefficient optimisation) through problem analyses, insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence, to actionable interventions are captured and interconnected; every node appears in at least one edge, with no isolated nodes. Frameworks (Adam, AdaMax) are decomposed into transparent component nodes.  

Key limitations:  
1. The paper is not an AI-safety paper; interventions are mapped to safety relevance (training stability) via moderate inference.  
2. Experimental evidence is limited to ML benchmarks; real-world deployment evidence is absent, so maturity levels are capped accordingly.  
3. The temporal-averaging extension lacks quantitative backing in the source, hence a low-confidence edge.
