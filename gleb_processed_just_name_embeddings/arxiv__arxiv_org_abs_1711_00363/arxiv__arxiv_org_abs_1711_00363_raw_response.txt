          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper “Servant of Many Masters: Shifting priorities in Pareto-optimal sequential decision-making” analyses how an AI agent that serves several principals with different beliefs should act. It proves (Pareto-optimal control theorem) that naïvely maximising a fixed linear combination of principals’ utilities is sub-optimal; instead the agent must dynamically re-weight each principal’s expected utility by how well that principal’s prior predicts observed evidence (“bet-settling”). A worked cake-betting example and formal proofs are supplied.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[88]  \nInference strategy justification: Interventions are not explicitly engineered in the text, so moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to phrase concrete AI-safety interventions that naturally operationalise the proved theorem (e.g. “design agents with dynamic likelihood-weighted aggregation”).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps from the top-level social-level risks (AI arms races & principal dissatisfaction) through problem analyses, insights, design logic, mechanisms, proofs, examples, and actionable interventions have been represented without dangling nodes. 16 nodes (~1 per 350 words) fit guideline density.  \nKey limitations: 1) Only a toy example validates the mechanism—real-world empirical evidence is absent. 2) Interventions 2–3 are organisational rather than algorithmic; effectiveness data is speculative. 3) Some naming decisions (e.g. “Competitive AI arms race…”) may differ from future canonical graph terminology.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Competitive AI arms race from inability to share AI systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AI deployment race due to non-shareable agents\",\"Race dynamics among principals\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that states, companies or individuals build separate, rapidly escalating AI systems instead of jointly owning one because shared systems cannot satisfy all principals, increasing accident and conflict likelihood.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Outlined in Conclusion – ‘Implications for bargaining versus racing’ as a principal safety concern.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Misallocation of utility among principals in multi-principal AI agents\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Unfair priority distribution\",\"Principal dissatisfaction\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that a shared AI consistently favours some principals’ preferences over others, undermining cooperation and leading to conflict or abandonment of the system.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced in Introduction and cake-betting example as the immediate failure mode of naïve utility aggregation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Differing priors between principals in shared decision-making contexts\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Belief disagreement among principals\",\"Different world-models\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Principals commonly hold distinct probabilistic beliefs about the environment;
