Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Servant of Many Masters: Shifting priorities in Pareto-optimal sequential decision-making” analyses how an AI agent that serves several principals with different beliefs should act. It proves (Pareto-optimal control theorem) that naïvely maximising a fixed linear combination of principals’ utilities is sub-optimal; instead the agent must dynamically re-weight each principal’s expected utility by how well that principal’s prior predicts observed evidence (“bet-settling”). A worked cake-betting example and formal proofs are supplied.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[88]  
Inference strategy justification: Interventions are not explicitly engineered in the text, so moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to phrase concrete AI-safety interventions that naturally operationalise the proved theorem (e.g. “design agents with dynamic likelihood-weighted aggregation”).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps from the top-level social-level risks (AI arms races & principal dissatisfaction) through problem analyses, insights, design logic, mechanisms, proofs, examples, and actionable interventions have been represented without dangling nodes. 16 nodes (~1 per 350 words) fit guideline density.  
Key limitations: 1) Only a toy example validates the mechanism—real-world empirical evidence is absent. 2) Interventions 2–3 are organisational rather than algorithmic; effectiveness data is speculative. 3) Some naming decisions (e.g. “Competitive AI arms race…”) may differ from future canonical graph terminology.
