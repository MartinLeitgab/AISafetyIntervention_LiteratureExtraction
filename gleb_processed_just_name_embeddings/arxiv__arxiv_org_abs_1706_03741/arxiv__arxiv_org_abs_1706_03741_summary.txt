Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences” proposes and experimentally validates a framework that learns a reward model from sparse human comparisons of short trajectory clips and optimizes that learned reward with standard deep-RL algorithms (A2C/TRPO). It shows near–true-reward performance on eight MuJoCo robotics tasks, substantial success on seven Atari games, and the learning of novel behaviors such as continuous back-flips, all with minutes-to-hours of non-expert feedback.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
Inference strategy justification: All nodes were taken directly from explicit statements or quantitatively supported findings; light inference (confidence = 2) was only used to translate implementation details into clearly actionable intervention wording.  
Extraction completeness explanation: 21 concept nodes capture every reasoning step from the core risk (reward misspecification) through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms and four clusters of validation evidence. Four intervention nodes cover every actionable recommendation implied or stated. All nodes are interconnected, no satellites remain, and framework components (e.g. reward predictor, asynchronous pipeline, ensemble uncertainty sampling) are decomposed.  
Key limitations: Granularity could still be too fine for some large-scale merges; future instructions might standardise preferred tense (“using” vs “use”) for intervention names and list canonical aliases.  

How the instruction set could be improved:  
1. Provide a canonical list of acceptable edge verbs mapped to the six concept-category transitions to minimise guesswork (“theoretical→design must use mitigated_by|enabled_by”).  
2. Explicitly clarify arrow direction semantics (e.g. “risk –caused_by→ problem” means risk is downstream of problem) to avoid reversal errors.  
3. Supply example JSON snippets that include aliases and rationales for interventions to ensure consistent formatting across sources.
