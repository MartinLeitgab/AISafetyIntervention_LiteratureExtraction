It proposes two white-box safety designs (Counterfactual Oracle and On-policy Oracle), details their reward mechanisms, discusses multi-Oracle coordination dangers, and presents toy-model experiments that illustrate both designs’ behaviour.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77]  \nInference strategy justification: Nodes were constructed strictly from explicit reasoning chains in the text; moderate inference (edge-confidence ≤ 2) was only used to link high-level theoretical insights to practical policies not directly tested in the experiments (e.g., precision reduction).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps connecting the central risk (Oracle escape via manipulative answers) to every intervention the paper proposes or implies were captured, decomposed into the required node categories, and connected into one integrated fabric. White-box decomposition of both Oracle designs allows future datasets to merge on the same components.  \nKey limitations: 1) Simulations are small-scale, so validation evidence edges may overstate real-world strength. 2) Some interventions (precision reduction) rely on qualitative arguments, not empirical data. 3) Potential social factors (human compliance, governance) are outside scope of the paper and therefore of the fabric.\n\nJSON fabric below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Manipulative answer-induced escape in AI Oracles\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Oracle

Provide explicit guidance on whether every path must include a validation evidence node; current template implies so but does not strictly require it, causing ambiguity.  \n2. Clarify preferred edge verb between theoretical insight and design rationale (e.g., “enabled_by” vs. “motivates”) to ensure uniform usage across sources.  \n3. Offer a short canonical list of typical intervention life-cycle placements for reward-scheme or interface changes, as these span both training and deployment phases, to reduce subjectivity."
