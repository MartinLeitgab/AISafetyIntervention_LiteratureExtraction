          "text": "Summary:\nThis paper (“Zero-Shot Visual Imitation via a Goal-Conditioned Skill Policy”) proposes a self-supervised alternative to classical learning-from-demonstration (LfD).  It identifies four safety-relevant risks—excessive expert supervision, imitation errors from multi-modal action spaces, poor skill generalisation, and compounding imitation errors—and builds a causal chain from these risks through analysis, theory, design, implementation and empirical evidence to three concrete interventions:  \n1. Train a goal-conditioned skill policy (GSP) with a forward-consistency loss on self-supervised exploration data.  \n2. Use curiosity-driven exploration to collect richer self-supervised data before GSP training.  \n3. Deploy a goal-recogniser at run time to decide when to switch sub-goals.  \n\nThe knowledge fabric below links every risk to all interventions through fully connected reasoning paths with no isolated nodes.\n\nExtraction confidence[87]\nThe paper is well structured, contains explicit motivation, method and validation, and maps cleanly onto the required node categories.  All node names follow the prescribed granularity and connect via evidence-rated edges.  Remaining uncertainty stems from moderate interpretive choices when mapping sections to node categories and assigning lifecycle stages.\n\nInference strategy justification\nLight inference (confidence 2) was used only where the paper implied but did not explicitly label causal links (e.g., curiosity improving state coverage).  All core technical claims and empirical findings are explicitly grounded in cited sections.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation\n28 concept nodes and 3 intervention nodes capture every distinct claim on the critical reasoning paths.  All implementation details (forward model, recurrent GSP, curiosity module, goal-recogniser) are decomposed rather than treated as black boxes, assuring merge-ability across 500 k sources.\n\nKey limitations\n1. Paper does not discuss catastrophic safety failures; extracted risks remain performance-oriented rather than existential.  \n2. Empirical evidence is limited in scale; maturity levels were therefore capped at “prototype”.  \n3. Edges marked confidence 2 rely on moderate inference where the paper hints rather than proves causality.  \n\nJSON knowledge fabric:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"High expert
