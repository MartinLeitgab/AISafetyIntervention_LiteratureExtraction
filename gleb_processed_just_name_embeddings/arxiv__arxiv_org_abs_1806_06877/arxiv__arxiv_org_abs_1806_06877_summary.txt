Summary  
This survey paper reviews the challenges of inverse-reinforcement-learning (IRL) (Sections 3–6) and the families of algorithms that have been proposed to overcome them (Sections 4–6), together with empirical evidence (Section 5).  The key AI-safety-relevant risk discussed is that mis-inferred reward functions can lead to unsafe downstream behaviour of autonomous systems.  We extract five major causal-interventional pathways from that risk through the successive reasoning layers defined in the prompt, ending in five actionable interventions (MaxEnt IRL, Bayesian IRL, Active-BIRL querying, Automatic feature construction, and Bisimulation-based abstraction).  All concept nodes are named at the required granularity and are fully connected, yielding one integrated knowledge fabric.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83] – High confidence that nodes/edges map faithfully to the paper’s arguments and that JSON is syntactically correct.  Possible misses: minor sub-claims or very small algorithmic variants not included to keep graph size manageable.

Instruction-set improvement: explicitly allow “addresses_by” as an edge verb between problem analysis and theoretical insight (rather than “caused_by”) to express directionality more naturally.

Inference strategy justification  
Where the paper only reports empirical trends (e.g. “improved robustness” for MaxEnt IRL), moderate inference was used to phrase them as validation evidence nodes (edge-confidence 3).  Interventions are phrased to be implementation-ready for downstream safety analysis and tagged with lifecycle & maturity according to the prompt.

Extraction completeness explanation  
30 nodes (~15 per 5 000 words) cover all core IRL challenges and the main families of mitigating methods, with explicit connections to their validation evidence and interventions.  Every node participates in at least one connected path; duplicate or dangling nodes were removed.

Key limitations  
1. The survey spans many minor variants; only the most widely-cited algorithmic families were instanced to keep node count tractable.  
2. Empirical evidence strength is often qualitative; edge confidence therefore capped at 3–4.  
3. Some cross-links between algorithmic families (e.g. combined MaxEnt+Bayesian approaches) were omitted for clarity.
