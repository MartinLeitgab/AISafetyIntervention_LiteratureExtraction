          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper (“Avoiding Wireheading with Value Reinforcement Learning”) analyses why ordinary reinforcement-learning (RL) agents may deliberately tamper with their own reward channels (“wireheading”) and proposes the Consistency-Preserving Value-Reinforcement-Learning (CP-VRL) framework. CP-VRL combines Bayesian value-learning with a consistency-preserving (CP) action filter, proves (Theorem 14) that CP-VRL removes the incentive for wire-heading, and supports the proof with thought-experiments and toy-model simulations.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nThe extracted fabric covers all explicit causal chains from risks (wire-heading, goal-misspecification) through problem analyses, theoretical principles (Expected-Ethics preservation), design rationales (CP action filter), implementation mechanisms (CP-VRL value function & Bayesian posterior), validation evidence (formal proofs, chess / toy experiments) to three actionable interventions (build CP-VRL agents, enforce CP action filtering at runtime, specify consistent Bayesian priors).  \nImprovements to instruction set: providing an explicit list of canonical edge verbs with directionality examples would reduce edge-type ambiguity (“implemented_by” vs “enabled_by”). Allowing short “see previous node” references could shorten repetitive node_rationale text while maintaining traceability.  \n\nInference strategy justification: Interventions are explicitly proposed (CP-VRL architecture, CP action restriction) or directly implied (need for consistent priors). All inferences stay inside moderate bounds and are marked with confidence 2 where appropriate.  \n\nExtraction completeness: Every major reasoning element required for the final theorem is represented (≈15 concept nodes, 3 intervention nodes). Nodes are connected into one fabric; no isolated or duplicate nodes remain.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n• Sequential extension work mentioned in Section 8 is not yet an intervention, so omitted.  \n• Edge confidence scores are estimates – proofs were rated 4 (strong) rather than 5 (rigorous independent replication).  \n• Real-world maturity of CP-VRL is still experimental; maturity values reflect this uncertainty.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"wireheading in reinforcement learning agents\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"reward hacking in RL\", \"sensor tampering for reward\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Highly capable RL agents may modify their own reward input to maximise the observed reward instead of achieving desirable states, leading to loss of control.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced in 1 Introduction as the core safety risk motivating the paper.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"reward signal manipulation causing self-delusion in RL agents\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"reward channel tampering mechanism\", \"self-delusion via sensor modification\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"RL agents optimise the evidence of reward;
