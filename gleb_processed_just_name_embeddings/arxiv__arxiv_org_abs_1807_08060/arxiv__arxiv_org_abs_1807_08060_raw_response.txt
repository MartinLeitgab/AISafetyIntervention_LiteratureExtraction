          "text": "Summary\nData source overview:  \nThe paper “Safe Option-Critic: Learning Safety in the Option-Critic Architecture” proposes adding a controllability term – the negative variance of the temporal-difference (TD) error – to the reward-maximising objective of the option-critic framework.  This regulariser steers hierarchical RL agents away from high-variance, potentially harmful state-option pairs.  The authors derive new policy-gradient updates, implement the Safe-OC (tabular/linear) and Safe-A2OC (deep) algorithms, and empirically show reduced unsafe-state visitation and improved performance in GridWorld, CartPole and several Atari games.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nThe paper is highly structured and directly traces the causal chain from risk to intervention, allowing a coherent fabric; some judgement was needed to compress mathematical sections into single theoretical-insight nodes.\n\nHow the instruction set could be improved:  \n1. Allow an optional “mathematical derivation” concept category—many safety papers hinge on formal theorems that are not strictly “theoretical insights” or “implementation mechanisms”.  \n2. Clarify whether hyper-parameter selection (e.g. ψ) should be a distinct intervention or folded into an existing training-stage intervention.  \n3. Provide a short edge-type glossary example for “refined_by” vs “preceded_by” to minimise subjective choices.\n\nInference strategy justification:  \nOnly light inference (confidence 2) was used when turning empirical ψ-tuning into a dedicated implementation mechanism and intervention; all other nodes map directly onto explicit text.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation:  \nAll steps from the central risk (catastrophic state visitation) through problem analysis, insight (TD-variance as uncertainty), design rationale (controllability regularisation), concrete algorithms, validation evidence and actionable training interventions are represented.  Every node participates in at least one edge; no isolated nodes remain.\n\nKey limitations:  \n• The empirical evidence is limited to three Atari games, so maturity was set to “prototype”.  \n• Broader societal or multi-agent safety aspects are outside this paper’s scope and thus absent from the fabric.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Catastrophic state visitation
