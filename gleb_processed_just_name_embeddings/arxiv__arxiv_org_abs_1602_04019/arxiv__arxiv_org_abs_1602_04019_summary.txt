Summary
Data source overview: The technical report “Energetics of the Brain and AI” (Sandberg, 2016) critiques claims that huge energy demands make advanced AI infeasible, argues that brain-level energy use is a poor guide for de-novo AI, and cites empirical and theoretical evidence for much lower power requirements through algorithmic abstraction and specialised hardware.  
Extraction CONFIDENCE[82]

Inference strategy justification: Where the report stated quantitative or qualitative relationships explicitly (e.g. GPU wattage, Koomey’s law) these were coded directly with confidence 4. When turning narrative arguments into structured causal links (e.g. “overestimated energy → complacency about AI risk”) moderate inference was applied (confidence 2-3) and marked accordingly. Interventions are not prescribed by the author, so pragmatic, safety-relevant interventions were inferred and flagged with maturity 1–3.

Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps that connect the top-level risk (AI safety complacency) to actionable interventions were extracted, keeping node granularity compatible with cross-source merging. Nodes that could not be attached were removed; remaining nodes are fully connected.

Key limitations: 1) Report is argumentative not experimental—validation nodes rely on secondary citations. 2) Some edge directions require interpretation because the paper is discursive. 3) Interventions are inferred policy/engineering steps rather than author-endorsed recommendations.



How to improve this extraction prompt:  
1. Provide explicit guidance on handling argumentative essays that do not state interventions—e.g., allow mapping to policy or research recommendations by default.  
2. Clarify preferred edge direction when a theoretical cause produces a problem versus mitigates it; examples with both patterns would reduce ambiguity.  
3. Supply a standardized section-title token list to reference when papers use narrative flow without headings.  
4. Offer a built-in list of typical AI-safety-relevant interventions (forecasting, governance, technical mitigations) to maintain naming consistency across sources.

Limitations: Narrative sources require subjective inference, and efficiency claims rely on secondary citations rather than controlled experiments, so confidence scores remain moderate.
