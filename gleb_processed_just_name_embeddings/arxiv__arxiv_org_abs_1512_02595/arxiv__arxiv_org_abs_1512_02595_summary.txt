Summary
Data source overview: The paper presents Deep Speech 2, an end-to-end automatic speech-recognition (ASR) system that replaces modular, hand-engineered pipelines with deep recurrent neural networks trained on very large datasets. It details architectural innovations (Batch Normalization, SortaGrad curriculum, 2-D convolutions, row-convolution for streaming), large-scale GPU training optimizations (custom GPU CTC, ring all-reduce) and a low-latency deployment stack (Batch Dispatch, half-precision kernels). Extensive experiments show up to 43 % WER reduction over the previous system, human-level performance on several benchmarks, near-linear training scaling and sub-70 ms 98-percentile deployment latency.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – High confidence that all key causal–interventional paths (accuracy, training-time, deployment-latency) are captured, nodes are unique & merge-ready, edges respect ordering, and JSON is valid. Minor uncertainty comes from manual summarisation of some long passages.

Instruction-set improvement suggestions: add explicit examples for splitting multiple concurrent implementation mechanisms that validate against the same evidence, and clarify preferred edge verb when chaining several “refined_by” relations out of one implementation mechanism.

Inference strategy justification: Only moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to phrase risks explicitly (the paper focuses on solutions), and to map lifecycle/maturity levels. All other nodes/edges are grounded in explicit sections (titles referenced in rationales).

Extraction completeness: 28 interconnected nodes (~1 per 450 words) cover every major reasoning step the authors use to go from three top-level risks (accuracy, training speed, deployment latency) to actionable interventions. All subsystems (architecture, curriculum, data, compute, deployment) appear and no node is left isolated.

Key limitations: 
1. The paper’s commercial context implies some proprietary details are omitted, so implementation nodes may still abstract over hidden engineering.
2. External generalisability of the interventions (e.g., to non-speech domains) is not proven.
3. Edge confidence scores rely on reported, not independently replicated, evidence.



Key verification checklist
✓ No risk ↔ intervention direct edges.  
✓ All nodes have at least one edge; no isolates.  
✓ Frameworks (e.g. “Batch Dispatch”, “row convolution”) decomposed into components.  
✓ JSON keys/names match exactly between nodes and edges.  
✓ Node naming granularity aligns with guidance.
