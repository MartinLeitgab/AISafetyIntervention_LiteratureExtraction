Summary
Data source overview: The paper “Apprenticeship Learning using Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Gradient Methods” introduces a gradient-based inverse-reinforcement-learning (IRL) algorithm that unifies direct policy-matching and model-based reward-learning.  Key technical contributions include (1) use of a supervised loss on the expert’s policy while optimising reward parameters, (2) calculation of natural gradients to cope with reward-parameter redundancy, (3) employment of Boltzmann stochastic policies to obtain differentiable greedy actions, and (4) derivation of a fixed-point equation for Q-value gradients.  Experiments in Grid-world and Sailing domains show markedly better robustness (especially to feature-scaling errors) and sample efficiency than the prior max-margin IRL method.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77]   
Inference strategy justification: Explicit causal chains from risks → problems → insights → design → implementation → evidence → interventions were built directly from the Introduction, Apprenticeship-Learning, Natural-Gradient, Gradient-Calculation and Computer-Experiments sections.  Light inference (confidence 2) was only applied when the paper implicitly motivated an intervention (e.g., “avoid feature-scaling sensitivity”).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All core reasoning pathways that justify the proposed gradient-IRL algorithm are captured, connecting three top-level risks (policy mis-generalisation, ill-posed reward recovery, feature-scaling sensitivity) through to five actionable interventions.  All nodes are interconnected; no satellites remain.  
Key limitations: 1) The source provides only experimental evidence from small domains, so edge confidences are ≤4. 2) The interventions are limited to the apprenticeship-learning stage (lifecycle 3). 3) Some assumptions (e.g., perfect state observability) are not modelled as separate risk nodes to keep the fabric concise.

Improvement suggestions for instruction set
1. Clarify the expected directionality of edge types in the template (e.g., whether “caused_by” always points from upstream risk to downstream cause or vice-versa) to minimise ambiguity.  
2. Provide explicit guidance on how to handle multiple overlapping risks sharing the same intermediate nodes; current instructions leave some discretion that may reduce cross-source mergeability.  
3. Allow “evidence strengthens” as an edge type to distinguish between validation that merely supports vs. conclusively validates an implementation.  
4. Add a short node-count heuristic table (e.g., 1000 words ≈ 3–5 risks, etc.) as a quick checkpoint.  

Key limitations of current extraction
• Evidence comes from toy domains; large-scale validation missing (edge confidences limited).  
• The paper does not discuss deployment-phase controls; fabric is therefore concentrated in lifecycle 3.  
• Some theoretical constructs (e.g., Riemannian geometry) were abstracted into single implementation nodes to keep granularity manageable; downstream analysts may need deeper decomposition if they study algorithmic robustness proofs.
