Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces Resource-Efficient Neural Architect (RENA), a reinforcement-learning-based neural-architecture-search (NAS) framework that automatically discovers high-performance neural networks which satisfy hardware resource constraints (model size, FLOPs, compute intensity). It embeds an existing network, applies insert/scale/remove actions, and optimizes a multi-objective reward with soft penalties for constraint violations. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Google Speech Commands show RENA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while meeting tight resource limits.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
The fabric captures all explicit causal chains from the core risks (resource overuse and latency) through problem mechanisms, insights, design rationales, implementation details, empirical validations, to three actionable interventions (use RENA, add compute-intensity objectives, use soft-penalty rewards). Node names are hardware-aware and mergeable. Edges follow mandated flow; no intervention connects directly to a risk.  

How instructions could be improved: Provide canonical risk/benefit examples for “efficiency” papers so downstream safety relevance is clearer; allow multi-word edge types (e.g. “improved_by”); clarify whether multiple validation evidences can stem from the same implementation mechanism without repeating edges.  

Inference strategy justification: Risks were inferred from the Introduction’s emphasis on deployment constraints. Soft-penalty intervention was inferred from Section 4.3 but is directly described in the equation, so only light inference (confidence 2) was required.  

Extraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning step mentioned in the paper that links constraints to RENA’s mechanisms and empirical findings is represented. Three distinct intervention nodes cover the actionable techniques a safety-minded practitioner could adopt. All nodes participate in the connected fabric; no isolated nodes remain.  

Key limitations:  
1. The paper does not address catastrophic safety failures, so applicability is limited to efficiency-related safety.  
2. Validation evidence is drawn only from CIFAR-10 and KWS, so generality is uncertain.  
3. Some causal links (e.g. from mismatch to soft penalties) required modest inference, lowering confidence on those edges.
