Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Can Intelligence Explode?” is a broad theoretical analysis of technological-singularity scenarios. It examines whether increasing computational resources will necessarily lead to an intelligence explosion, how such a process would appear to insiders vs. outsiders, and what evolutionary, economic and theoretical forces (especially AIXI-style reward maximisation) imply for risks such as human displacement, moral erosion, oversight failure and goal mis-alignment. Although largely philosophical, it contains clear causal reasoning that can be turned into AI-safety knowledge fabrics.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
The extraction follows the required node/edge schema, decomposes all arguments into merge-able granular concepts, and links every path from risk to intervention without isolated nodes. Confidence is not 100 because the paper is speculative (edge evidence is often medium/weak) and does not present empirical interventions, so several intervention nodes are moderately inferred.

Instruction-set improvement: add an explicit mapping table from speculative/philosophical evidence classes to edge-confidence numbers; give more examples for connecting “problem analysis → theoretical insight” edges.

Inference strategy justification: When the paper offered no direct intervention proposals, moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to derive the most standard safety interventions that logically address the identified mechanisms, always explained in edge rationales.

Extraction completeness: Four top-level risks appearing throughout the paper were captured; every supporting mechanism, insight, design rationale, implementation mechanism, validation evidence and intervention needed to traverse from each risk to an actionable mitigation is included, yielding 28 inter-connected nodes.

Key limitations: 1) empirical validation in the source is scarce, so validation-evidence nodes rely on analogical or historical data; 2) interventions are policy or architecture level rather than algorithmic specifics; 3) the philosophical nature of the text forced subjective granularity choices.
