Summary  
Data source overview: The paper analyzes how character-level Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems can be driven into severe, real-world mistranslations by tiny character perturbations and presents gradient-based white-box attacks together with adversarial-training defences (FIDS-W and an Ensemble model). Extensive experiments on IWSLT TED-talk data show that (1) white-box attacks are far more powerful than prior black-box heuristics and (2) training on these stronger attacks – especially when combined with black-box noise – substantially improves robustness across several noise distributions.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[88]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper explicitly spells out every causal layer from observed risk to validated intervention. Only very light inference (edge E2) was required to connect the black-box-testing shortcoming to overall risk; this is marked low-confidence.  
Extraction completeness: All reasoning steps that justify the proposed training and evaluation interventions are decomposed into 17 nodes, each connected within a single fabric. Duplicate or satellite nodes were removed.  
Key limitations: 1) The fabric is restricted to MT robustness; transfer to broader AI-safety contexts may need additional bridging nodes from other sources. 2) The maturity levels are estimated from experimental scale, not industry deployment reports. 3) Edge directions follow the required template but alternative causal orderings are possible.

How to improve instruction set: Allow an explicit “exacerbated_by | not_detected_by” edge for situations where a diagnostic failure increases risk but does not cause it directly; this avoids forcing weak “caused_by” edges.



Key checklist confirmations  
✓ No edge directly links a risk node to an intervention node.  
✓ All nodes participate in at least one edge; fabric is fully connected.  
✓ HotFlip/FIDS framework decomposed into white-box components, avoiding black-box node.  
✓ Node names follow required granularity.  
✓ JSON structure validated for matching node names and formatting.
