          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper “Limits to Verification and Validation of Agentic Behavior” argues that, for general-purpose AI systems, (1) verifying that an agent will always act “Good” is formally undecidable, (2) validating outcomes is infeasible because the physical world is unpredictable, and (3) popular layered “ethical governor” designs only check intentions, not real-world consequences. The author surveys manual proof burdens, deontological-governor ideas, capability-limitation proposals, and warns against “language of certainty”.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  \nThe extraction follows every instruction (node naming templates, edge flow, attribute completion, JSON validity). I am 82 % confident no stray or duplicate nodes exist and every node is connected. Remaining uncertainty stems from compressing a 12-page theoretical paper into 18 nodes and assigning edge confidences from largely theoretical evidence.  \n\nInstruction-set improvement suggestions:  \n1. Provide an allowed list of edge verbs with definitions; “refined_by” or “explained_by” were not on the canonical list, so mapping theoretical explanation edges required judgement.  \n2. Clarify whether validation-evidence → intervention edges must always be “motivates” or if “enabled_by” is acceptable.  \n3. Give explicit guidance for purely theoretical papers that lack empirical validation so that “validation evidence” nodes may reference proofs rather than experiments.  \n\nInference strategy justification  \n• Interventions are lightly inferred (paper proposes concepts but not development plans). Each such edge is marked with confidence 2.  \n• Node splitting followed white-box guidance: “deontological governor” decomposed into design rationale, implementation mechanism, and deployment intervention.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nEvery causal chain mentioned in the paper—undecidability, world-model uncertainty, manual-proof burden—has a full path from risk to actionable intervention. All nodes share at least one edge; no isolated components remain.  \n\nKey limitations  \n• Evidence is purely theoretical; validation-evidence nodes therefore rely on proofs, not empirical data.  \n• Some design-rationale ↔ implementation mappings required modest inference because the paper is discursive rather than engineering-focused.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\":
