          "text": "Summary\nThe paper introduces Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), a framework that trains a generator network by pitting it against a discriminator network in a minimax game. The authors analyse theoretical convergence, present a practical training algorithm, and demonstrate competitive sample quality and Parzen‐window log-likelihood on MNIST, TFD and CIFAR-10.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[90]  \nThe extraction captures every causal-interventional chain linking the three principal risks (intractable likelihoods, slow Markov-chain mixing, and vanishing generator gradients) to four concrete training interventions (full GAN training, alternative generator loss, one-step discriminator updates, and dropout in D). Node names follow the mandated patterns and should merge well across sources.  \n\nInference strategy justification  \nAll nodes and edges are grounded in explicit statements in Sections 1–6. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was only used to classify algorithmic details as interventions relevant to AI-safety-oriented model development practices.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nAll logically distinct claims that participate in the risk→method→evidence→intervention fabric were extracted (19 nodes ≈ 1 per 330 words). Framework components (objective, alternating updates, architecture) were decomposed into white-box nodes rather than a monolithic “GAN” node. All nodes are connected; no isolated satellites remain.  \n\nKey limitations  \n1. Validation evidence is limited to small-scale empirical results, so edge confidences are mostly “3” or “4”.  \n2. The paper does not discuss downstream misuse risks; only training-phase risks could be extracted.  \n3. Some edges (e.g. dropout motivation) rely on indirect evidence and are marked with lower confidence.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Intractable likelihood estimation in deep
