Summary  
Data source overview: The paper analyzes human‐centered reinforcement learning (HCRL) and shows that people give policy-dependent rather than policy-independent numeric feedback. It introduces the COACH algorithm, which interprets feedback as an estimate of the advantage function and updates a policy directly, and validates COACH with an online AMT study and a TurtleBot robotics case study.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[92]  
Inference strategy justification: Only minimal inference was used to (i) phrase top-level AI–safety risks in the same granularity as the paper’s motivation, and (ii) turn COACH’s steps into explicit interventions. All reasoning steps are traceable to titled sections.  

Extraction completeness explanation: 19 nodes (~1 per 450 words) capture every distinct claim that links the risks of unintended behaviour and trainer burden to concrete, validated interventions. All causal–interventional paths are connected through the prescribed six concept categories and end in four actionable interventions.  

Key limitations:  
1. The robotics study is qualitative; maturity ratings are limited to prototype level.  
2. Some edge confidences are set to 3 (medium) where only argumentative rather than quantitative evidence is given.  
3. The paper does not report large-scale deployments, so operational-level interventions could not be extracted.  

Potential instruction-set improvement: Provide an explicit mapping of typical paper section titles to concept categories to speed up manual mapping; clarify how to handle multiple risk nodes that share identical downstream chains to reduce repetition.



MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST  
✔ No edge connects risk directly to intervention.  
✔ All pathways are connected via shared nodes; no isolated reasoning paths.  
✔ Every node is referenced by at least one edge, preventing satellites.  
✔ COACH framework decomposed into multiple implementation-mechanism nodes.  
✔ Node names follow prescribed granularity patterns.  
✔ JSON structure validated; node names in edges match exactly.
