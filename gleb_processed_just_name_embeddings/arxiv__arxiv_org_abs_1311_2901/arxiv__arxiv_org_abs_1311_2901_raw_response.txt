          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: Zeiler & Fergus (2014) present a method for visualizing and analysing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) using layer-wise deconvolutional networks (deconvnets). The paper demonstrates how these visualisations uncover aliasing and feature-dominance problems, guide architectural changes (7×7 stride-2 first-layer filters, filter RMS renormalisation) and validate that networks attend to object regions via occlusion sensitivity.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  \nInference strategy justification: Only explicit causal claims were extracted; modest inference (edge confidence 2) was used solely where the paper implies but does not state an edge (e.g. visualisation → workflow integration).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains from the top-level risk (opacity of ConvNets) to every actionable intervention proposed or demonstrated in the paper were captured, merged into one connected fabric and de-duplicated.  \nKey limitations: 1) Paper centres on vision models; generalisation to other modalities is inferred only indirectly. 2) Interventions are research-grade; operational maturity remains low. 3) Some causal directions are theory-driven rather than experimentally isolated, reflected in confidence scores.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Opaque decision-making in deep

Clarify whether multiple validation evidence nodes should all connect directly to the same implementation mechanism or be chained; current rules allow both but explicit guidance would aid consistency across sources.\n2. Provide an explicit list of acceptable edge directions (source→target) to avoid ambiguity (e.g. “validated_by” can plausibly be read both ways).\n3.
