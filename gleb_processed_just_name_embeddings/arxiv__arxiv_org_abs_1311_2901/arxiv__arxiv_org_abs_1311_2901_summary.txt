Summary
Data source overview: Zeiler & Fergus (2014) present a method for visualizing and analysing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) using layer-wise deconvolutional networks (deconvnets). The paper demonstrates how these visualisations uncover aliasing and feature-dominance problems, guide architectural changes (7×7 stride-2 first-layer filters, filter RMS renormalisation) and validate that networks attend to object regions via occlusion sensitivity.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
Inference strategy justification: Only explicit causal claims were extracted; modest inference (edge confidence 2) was used solely where the paper implies but does not state an edge (e.g. visualisation → workflow integration).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains from the top-level risk (opacity of ConvNets) to every actionable intervention proposed or demonstrated in the paper were captured, merged into one connected fabric and de-duplicated.  
Key limitations: 1) Paper centres on vision models; generalisation to other modalities is inferred only indirectly. 2) Interventions are research-grade; operational maturity remains low. 3) Some causal directions are theory-driven rather than experimentally isolated, reflected in confidence scores.

How to improve the instruction set
1. Clarify whether multiple validation evidence nodes should all connect directly to the same implementation mechanism or be chained; current rules allow both but explicit guidance would aid consistency across sources.
2. Provide an explicit list of acceptable edge directions (source→target) to avoid ambiguity (e.g. “validated_by” can plausibly be read both ways).
3. Add examples for multiple branching interventions motivated by a single evidence node to reinforce branching fabrics.
