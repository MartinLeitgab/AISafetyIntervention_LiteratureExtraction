          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper “Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning” presents a method in which a recurrent-network “controller” automatically generates neural-network architectures, trains each sampled “child” model, and uses the obtained validation accuracy as a reinforcement-learning reward. The approach is scaled with distributed asynchronous training and extended with mechanisms for skip-connections and tree-structured recurrent cells. Experiments on CIFAR-10 image classification and Penn-Treebank language modeling show state-of-the-art performance.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  \nInference strategy justification: The source does not explicitly frame work in AI-safety terminology; moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to cast the core contribution as an intervention that mitigates the risk of deploying sub-optimal, poorly-vetted model architectures, a recognised reliability concern for AI systems.  \nExtraction completeness: All reasoning steps from the identified risk to the demonstrated intervention are represented, including subsidiary problems (manual design burden, fixed-length search limitations, slow neuro-evolution), theoretical insights, design rationales, concrete mechanisms, and three sets of validation evidence covering vision, language, and transfer learning.  \nKey limitations: The risk chosen is one of performance/robustness rather than catastrophic safety; other works may link to stronger safety consequences. Edge confidences could be improved with formal statistical metrics that are not fully reported in the paper.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Suboptimal neural network
