Summary
Data source overview: The paper “Trial without Error: Towards Safe Reinforcement Learning via Human Intervention” proposes Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HIRL). A human blocks catastrophic actions during an initial oversight phase; the collected data trains a supervised “Blocker” that takes over and continues to prevent catastrophes. Experiments on three Atari games show zero catastrophes in two games and a 50× reduction in the third, while revealing scalability limits arising from human labour and adversarial distribution shift.

Inference strategy justification: Wherever the text provided explicit causal reasoning we used it verbatim; for forward-looking ideas in the Discussion (data-efficient blockers, active learning, model-based RL) we applied moderate inference (confidence = 2) to phrase them as AI-safety interventions.

Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains from the primary risks (catastrophic actions and scalability of oversight) through mechanisms, insights, design choices, implementations and empirical findings to the six families of proposed or implied interventions are captured and interconnected—forming a single fabric without isolated nodes.

Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence is drawn from toy Atari domains, so generalisability is uncertain. 2) Some edges required moderate inference where the paper only sketched future work. 3) Node descriptions are brief to stay within token limits; richer quantitative detail could further improve merge-ability.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]

How to improve the instruction set: Clarify whether textual/qualitative arguments without experiments should be tagged “validation evidence” or “theoretical insight”; specify token budget for node descriptions; supply a canonical list of acceptable edge verbs to avoid synonym proliferation.

Extraction limitations: some edge strengths rely on qualitative judgement; future work edges hold lower confidence as indicated.
