Summary
Data source overview: The paper surveys a decade of work on mathematically modelling humans inside the robot-planning loop. It argues that treating humans as rational (or bounded-rational) agents whose actions and inferences both influence and inform the robot enables substantially safer and more useful behaviour. The text spans three main risk areas: (1) misspecified robot objectives, (2) inefficient or unsafe coordination, and (3) human misunderstanding of robot intent. For each, the authors develop theoretical insights, design rationales, concrete planning/learning mechanisms, and experimental validations that jointly form a connected causal-interventional fabric.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84]
This extraction follows the required node-type ordering, removes isolated nodes, decomposes large frameworks, and gives consistent merge-ready names. Some judgement calls were needed when mapping rich behaviours to the six concept categories and when inferring suitable intervention lifecycle/maturity levels, but overall confidence is high.

How to improve the instruction set:  
1. Provide canonical examples for mapping repeated experimental “conditions” (e.g. Fixed vs. Reactive) to node categories.  
2. Clarify whether “addressed_by” or “mitigated_by” is preferred between Problem-Analysis → Theoretical-Insight to improve cross-fabric uniformity.  
3. Supply guidance for condensing very long sources so node count scales smoothly with word count.

Inference strategy justification
Moderate inference (confidence = 2) is explicitly flagged where interventions are only implicitly suggested, e.g. generalising the driving-simulator planner into a deployable AV intervention. All other edges rely on the paper’s stated empirical or theoretical support.

Extraction completeness explanation
All reasoning chains appearing in the text that link any of the three top-level risks to at least one concrete intervention are captured and interconnected. Shared nodes (e.g. “Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning…”) fuse parallel paths, ensuring one connected fabric.

Key limitations
• The original paper bundles several distinct empirical studies; some nuances of each study (sample sizes, metrics) are not fully represented in the validation-evidence node descriptions.  
• Lifecycles/maturity are approximate because real deployment status is not always stated.  
• Only the most salient interventions were extracted to keep node count reasonable.



Limitations: due to space, some peripheral studies (e.g., communicating confidence) were omitted, though core fabric remains connected.
