          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper introduces Expert Iteration (ExIt), a reinforcement-learning framework that alternates (1) planning with a tree–search “expert” and (2) imitation-learning “apprentice” updates of a neural policy. Tested on 9 × 9 Hex, ExIt (especially its neural-MCTS, cost-sensitive training targets, and online dataset aggregation variant) dramatically outperforms baseline MCTS and REINFORCE.  \nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nInference strategy justification: The paper is optimisation-performance–focused rather than safety-oriented, so moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to recast poor learning efficiency as the salient “risk” and to treat the proposed algorithmic improvements as interventions that mitigate that risk.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains linking the principal risk (inefficient learning in complex tasks) to each concrete algorithmic intervention (ExIt with neural-MCTS, Tree-Policy-Target training, online dataset aggregation) were captured via a fully connected fabric that follows the mandated node type order. All validation data reported in the paper are included as validation-evidence nodes that motivate the interventions.  \nKey limitations: 1) The paper does not measure long-term safety properties, so risk framing required inference. 2) Validation evidence is domain-specific (Hex); generalisation strength is uncertain. 3) Only three main implementation mechanisms were extracted; minor hyper-parameter details were omitted as they do not materially change causal pathways.  \n\nJSON knowledge fabric below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Inefficient learning

Clarify acceptable edge directions between problem analysis and theoretical insight; real texts often present theoretical insights as solutions rather than causes.  \n2. Provide a concise list of preferred edge verbs mapped to typical node transitions to avoid ambiguity (e.g., risk→problem=caused_by, problem→theory=mitigated_by).  \n3. Allow optional high-level “efficiency/performance” risks when papers are optimisation-focused so that safety analysts can still link algorithmic advances to future safety stakes without heavy inference."
