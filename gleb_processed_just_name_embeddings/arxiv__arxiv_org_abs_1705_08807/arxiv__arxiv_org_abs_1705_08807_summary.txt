Summary:
This supplementary information reports a 2016-2017 survey of 406 Machine-Learning researchers that elicited probabilistic forecasts for high-level machine intelligence (HLMI), automation of human jobs, intelligence-explosion likelihood, welfare impacts, and the perceived importance of AI-safety research. It details question framings, statistical aggregation (gamma-CDF mixtures, robust regressions), and demographic effects. Although the paper is descriptive, the empirical findings naturally motivate governance and research interventions aimed at reducing strategic uncertainty, preventing goal-misalignment, and mitigating labour displacement.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[78]
The fabric links every top-level risk discussed (intelligence explosion, goal mis-alignment, economic displacement) to the only empirically grounded mechanisms in the source (survey framing effects, demographic correlations, expressed safety priorities). Where the paper is descriptive, moderate inference (confidence≤2) was applied to derive plausible AI-safety interventions (e.g., periodic expert surveys, dedicated safety-research funding). Instructions could be improved by clarifying how to treat purely descriptive sources with no explicit interventions and by giving more examples of policy-level interventions.

Inference strategy justification:
• Strictly confined inference to directions clearly suggested by survey findings (e.g., framing ➔ uncertainty ➔ need for regular surveys).  
• Marked all such edges with confidence 1-2.  
• Did not invent technical safety mechanisms absent from the paper.

Extraction completeness explanation:
All statistically supported claims (framing effect, demographic impact, safety-priority answers) and all survey-based findings that bear on AI-safety reasoning are represented. Nodes were merged or split to obey granularity rules and ensure fabric connectivity.

Key limitations:
• The paper lacks direct experimental safety interventions, so policy-level interventions are inferred with lower confidence.  
• Quantitative timeline values are not encoded to keep nodes mergeable across 500 k sources.  
• Some causal links (e.g., uncertainty ➔ intelligence-explosion risk) rely on domain reasoning rather than explicit statements.
