          "text": "Summary  \nThe paper argues that failures in specifying AI goal structures can lead to catastrophic value-misalignment, especially for highly capable or super-intelligent systems.  It proposes that AI agents should begin with an uncertain goal model seeded with “mammalian value” priors derived from comparative neuroscience, and then learn the full richness of human values by observing behaviour using inverse-reinforcement-learning (IRL) or Bayesian inverse planning (BIP).  Russell’s three principles for human-compatible AI and learning from large-scale video data are suggested implementation routes.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82] – The fabric covers every explicit reasoning step presented in the article, decomposes frameworks into white-box components, and connects all risks to interventions without isolated nodes.  Instructions could be improved by supplying canonical confidence heuristics for purely theoretical arguments with no empirical data.\n\nInference strategy justification  \nWhere the article only sketches future work (e.g. training on video corpora) I created low-maturity intervention nodes and marked edges with confidence 2.  No speculative links beyond what an AI-safety reader would naturally infer were added.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nAll distinct claims that participate in causal chains from “value-misalignment risk” to concrete design or training interventions are represented (~19 concept nodes, 4 intervention nodes).  Neuroscientific evidence, IRL demonstrations, and Russell’s principles provide the required validation evidence nodes, ensuring every path adheres to the mandated sequence Risk→…→Intervention.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Paper is largely theoretical, so validation evidence is weaker than for empirical studies.  \n• Some implementation mechanisms (e.g. video-learning) lack direct experimental validation in the text, so edges are low-confidence.  \n• Cultural-evolution components are mentioned but not operationalised, so were excluded to avoid unconnected nodes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\":
