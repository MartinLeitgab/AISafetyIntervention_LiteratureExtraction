Summary  
Data‐source overview: The paper introduces two new neural components, the Neural Accumulator (NAC) and the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU), intended to give ordinary neural networks an inductive bias for exact arithmetic. By constraining weights and using single-neuron number representations, the modules allow networks to extrapolate reliably to numbers far outside the training range, something that standard nonlinear architectures fail to do. The authors validate the idea across seven domains (synthetic arithmetic, images, language, program execution, reinforcement learning, etc.).  

Extraction confidence[82]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper explicitly spells out the causal chain from the observed extrapolation failure to the proposed architectural fixes. All nodes were created following the mandatory category patterns. Interventions are limited to inserting NAC/NALU modules, which is explicitly discussed and repeatedly validated. Moderate inference (edge confidence 2) was only needed to connect “lack of inductive bias” to “single-neuron representation,” everything else is explicit experimental evidence.  
Extraction completeness: Every step of the reasoning—risk ⇒ problem analysis ⇒ theoretical insight ⇒ design rationale ⇒ implementation ⇒ validation ⇒ intervention—appears in at least one path and all nodes are connected. Approximately one node per 350 words (~17 nodes) meets the required density.  
Key limitations: The source is a single research paper, so maturity levels remain experimental. Long-term deployment risks or integration with full AI safety pipelines are not covered. Some edges (e.g. relating inductive bias to single-neuron representations) rely on author claims rather than formal proof.



Possible instruction‐set improvements  
1. Provide a strictly ordered canonical list of edge verbs per category pair to reduce judgment calls.  
2. Clarify whether multiple theoretical insights can independently spawn separate design rationales or must be combined.  
3. Examples for confidence scoring on mixed qualitative/quantitative evidence would aid consistency.
