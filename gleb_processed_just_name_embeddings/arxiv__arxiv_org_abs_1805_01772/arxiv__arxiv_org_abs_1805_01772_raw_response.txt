          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of in-graph dynamic control-flow support inside TensorFlow, including primitives, distributed execution, automatic differentiation and memory-management techniques such as asynchronous GPU↔CPU swapping. Empirical results show large speed-ups, memory savings and wider model expressiveness compared with prior out-of-graph or statically-unrolled approaches.  \n\nInference strategy justification: Risks were inferred directly from the authors’ motivation sections (Introduction §1, Programming with Control Flow §2) that emphasise performance, memory and expressiveness failures that hinder advanced ML development. Interventions were extracted from concrete mechanisms the authors deployed (control-flow primitives, memory swapping) and are already operational inside TensorFlow, therefore mapped to lifecycle/maturity levels accordingly.  \n\nExtraction completeness: Three risk families (performance, memory, expressiveness) cover the core challenges addressed in the paper; every reasoning chain from each risk to its corresponding intervention traverses problem analysis → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → validation evidence and ends at an actionable intervention, with shared nodes inter-connecting all paths into a single fabric. All nodes have at least one edge and no intervention connects directly to a risk.  \n\nKey limitations: 1) The paper is systems-oriented not safety-oriented, so risks are framed around engineering bottlenecks rather than catastrophic AI failures; 2) Some edge directions (e.g. “caused_by” vs “mitigated_by”) rely on moderate interpretive judgement; 3) Validation evidence relies on reported benchmarks without raw data replication.  \n\nEXTRACTION_CONFIDENCE[83] – high confidence in structural correctness; moderate uncertainty in optimal edge verb selection where the paper was descriptive rather than explicitly causal.  \n\nJSON knowledge fabric below.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"training performance bottlenecks in large-scale dynamic neural networks\",\n
