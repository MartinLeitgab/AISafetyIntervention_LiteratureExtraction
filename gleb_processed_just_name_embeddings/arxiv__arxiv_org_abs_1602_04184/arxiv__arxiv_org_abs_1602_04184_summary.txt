Summary
Data source overview:  
The paper introduces a parametric, resource-bounded version of Löb’s theorem and shows how it enables the design of computable “G-fair” agents (e.g. FairBotk) that robustly achieve mutual cooperation – and avoid exploitation – in a one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma when agents can read each other’s source code.  It also analyses why classical Nash equilibria and causal decision theory fail in such source-transparent settings.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
The fabric captures every explicit causal chain from the three main risks (persistent defection, exploitation, and decision-theory inadequacy) through the paper’s logical results (bounded Löb, G-fairness) to the concrete agent designs (FairBotk / G-fair architecture) and their proposed use as interventions.  Paths are fully connected, node names follow the requested granularity, and no isolated nodes remain.  Remaining uncertainty (≈18 %) comes from interpretive choices in mapping formal proofs to “validation evidence” nodes and choosing edge verbs that best fit conceptual relations.

Inference strategy justification  
All interventions are explicitly described as algorithmic prescriptions in Sections 1.3, 6, 7, so no speculative inference was needed.  Moderate structuring inference (confidence 2) was applied only when converting formal statements into graph edge types.

Extraction completeness explanation  
All distinct concepts that participate in any reasoning step (risks → methods → findings → interventions) were extracted (~21 nodes for ~15 000 words).  Nodes were split so that identical ideas from future sources can merge cleanly (e.g. “FairBot_k algorithm with bounded proof search for cooperation proofs”).

Key limitations  
• Validation evidence is theoretical rather than empirical; real-world performance is untested.  
• The interventions’ maturity is low (proof-of-concept).  
• The paper assumes perfect source-code transparency; practical constraints may alter outcomes.
