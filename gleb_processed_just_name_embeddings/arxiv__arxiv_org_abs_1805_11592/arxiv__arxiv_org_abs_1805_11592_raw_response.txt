It proposes two self-supervised objectives—Temporal-Distance Classification (TDC) and Cross-Modal Temporal-Distance Classification (CMC)—that learn a domain-invariant visual/audio embedding. Check-points sampled along an embedded YouTube video are then converted into an imitation reward that guides an IMPALA agent to achieve, and even exceed, human-level scores on Montezuma’s Revenge, Pitfall! and Private Eye.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nInference strategy justification: explicit causal links are taken directly from the paper’s section titles and results; moderate inference (confidence 2) is only applied where an implicit step had to be added to keep every path connected (e.g. mapping “cycle-consistency” evaluation to a pre-deployment model-selection intervention).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: every reasoning element that the paper uses to justify its method—risks, domain gap issues, representation-learning insight, design choices, concrete neural architectures, quantitative evidence, and resulting training procedures—appears as a node; all are inter-connected; no duplicates or orphans exist.  \nKey limitations: paper focuses on performance rather than classical AI-safety risks; intervention maturity is limited to prototype stage; edges use author-reported evidence but no statistical significance is provided for score improvements.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Hard exploration failure in deep RL agents on sparse-reward Atari games\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"RL exploration failure on
