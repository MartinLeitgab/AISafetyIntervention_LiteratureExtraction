Summary
Data source overview:  
This paper (“Playing hard exploration games by watching YouTube”) introduces a method that lets reinforcement-learning (RL) agents learn to solve very sparse-reward Atari games purely by watching unaligned, noisy YouTube videos. It proposes two self-supervised objectives—Temporal-Distance Classification (TDC) and Cross-Modal Temporal-Distance Classification (CMC)—that learn a domain-invariant visual/audio embedding. Check-points sampled along an embedded YouTube video are then converted into an imitation reward that guides an IMPALA agent to achieve, and even exceed, human-level scores on Montezuma’s Revenge, Pitfall! and Private Eye.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
Inference strategy justification: explicit causal links are taken directly from the paper’s section titles and results; moderate inference (confidence 2) is only applied where an implicit step had to be added to keep every path connected (e.g. mapping “cycle-consistency” evaluation to a pre-deployment model-selection intervention).  
Extraction completeness explanation: every reasoning element that the paper uses to justify its method—risks, domain gap issues, representation-learning insight, design choices, concrete neural architectures, quantitative evidence, and resulting training procedures—appears as a node; all are inter-connected; no duplicates or orphans exist.  
Key limitations: paper focuses on performance rather than classical AI-safety risks; intervention maturity is limited to prototype stage; edges use author-reported evidence but no statistical significance is provided for score improvements.



MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST  
✅ No risk-to-intervention direct edges.  
✅ All nodes participate in at least one edge; no isolated paths.  
✅ Framework (TDC+CMC, checkpoint reward, cycle-consistency) decomposed into white-box components.  
✅ Node names follow required granularity and are consistent with AI-safety corpus.  
✅ JSON is syntactically valid and all node names referenced in edges match exactly.
