Summary

Data source overview:  
The paper “Learning the Preferences of Ignorant, Inconsistent Agents” proposes a Bayesian-inverse-planning framework that explicitly models systematic human deviations from rational choice—false beliefs and hyperbolic time-inconsistency (Naive vs Sophisticated)—in order to infer true preferences from observed behavior. Implemented in the probabilistic-programming language WebPPL and validated in Gridworld case studies and three human-subject experiments, the approach outperforms standard inverse‐reinforcement-learning (IRL) methods that assume optimal rational actors.

Inference strategy justification:  
All causal chains were traced from the top-level AI-safety risk (wrong preference inference → misaligned behaviour) through: 1) problem analyses (incorrect rationality assumptions, unmodelled systematic biases), 2) theoretical insights (need to model structured deviations; Bayesian joint inference), 3) design rationales (how to extend agent models), 4) implementation mechanisms (soft-max hyperbolic discounting in WebPPL, exact enumeration), 5) validation evidence (Gridworld & human studies), to 6) actionable interventions (build bias-aware probabilistic preference-inference modules). Moderate but explicit inference was used only to generalize the paper’s algorithm into AI-safety interventions.

Extraction completeness explanation:  
15 inter-connected nodes (≈1 per 350 words) capture every distinct claim, method, finding and intervention that participates in any reasoning path in the paper. All nodes connect into one fabric; no duplicates or satellites remain.

Key limitations:  
• The paper’s scope is proof-of-concept; validation evidence is limited to toy domains and small MTurk studies, so edge confidence never exceeds 3.  
• Interventions are design-level proposals; real-world deployment details are not provided.  
• Some wording choices (e.g. node granularity) may still diverge slightly from other sources; future automated synonym mapping could improve merging.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]

Improvements for instruction set:  
Clarify whether “enabled_by” edges should originate from or point to the enabling node; give one concrete example for each canonical edge verb. Add guidance on handling bidirectional conceptual refinement vs causal directionality to reduce ambiguity during extraction.
