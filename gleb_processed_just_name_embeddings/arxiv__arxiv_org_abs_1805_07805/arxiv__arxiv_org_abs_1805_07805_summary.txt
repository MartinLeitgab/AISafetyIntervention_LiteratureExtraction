Summary  
Data source overview: The paper proposes Rerouted Behavior Improvement (RBI), a constrained-policy-improvement framework for reinforcement-learning agents that simultaneously addresses safety (avoiding catastrophic value drops when learning from finite data) and data efficiency. The authors derive the reroute constraint theoretically, supply a Max-Reroute algorithm and an actor-learner training recipe, and validate them on analytical proofs, two-armed bandits and Atari experiments.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: Only explicit causal chains appearing in theory sections (2.2–2.5), experiments (Sections 3–5) and conclusions were used. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied only where the paper implicitly motivates interventions (e.g. parameter choices).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning paths from the two headline risks (catastrophic degradation, poor sample efficiency) through variance-based error analysis, constraint design, algorithmic mechanisms and four layers of empirical evidence were captured, then linked to four actionable interventions that practitioners could adopt. All nodes are connected; no duplicates or orphans exist.  
Key limitations: Paper-specific hyper-parameters (e.g. cmin=0.1) may not generalise to other sources; future extraction guidelines could clarify whether such parameter-specific interventions should be split into separate nodes or attached as attributes.
