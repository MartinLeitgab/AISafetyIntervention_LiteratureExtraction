          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper “Leave No Trace: Learning to Reset for Safe and Autonomous Reinforcement Learning” proposes jointly learning a task (“forward”) policy and a “reset” policy together with an early-abort mechanism based on the reset policy’s value function (optionally using an ensemble for uncertainty). In simulated continuous-control tasks, the method achieves comparable or higher rewards while requiring far fewer manual (hard) resets and avoiding irreversible states.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nInference strategy justification: Only explicit claims appearing in the text were used. Where the paper hinted but did not formalise implementation details (e.g. parameter choices), light inference (edge confidence = 2) was applied and clearly marked.  \nExtraction completeness: All reasoning chains from the two top-level risks (irreversible states; lack of scalability from manual resets) through problem analyses, insights, design rationales, mechanisms, evidence and to four concrete interventions were captured and interconnected. No isolated nodes remain.  \nKey limitations: The paper is simulation-only; therefore maturity levels are still experimental (2-3). Some causal links (e.g. from theoretical insight to design choice) rely on author reasoning rather than controlled ablations and were assigned medium confidence.  \nInstruction-set improvement suggestion: Provide an explicit mapping from sections to concept categories so that “Background” or “Related Work” statements that are not part of the causal chain can be safely omitted, reducing node noise.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Irrecoverable state entry during real-world RL training\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"irreversible states in physical RL\", \"catastrophic unrecoverable states during robot learning\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Agents may perform actions that leave the robot or environment in states from which autonomous recovery is impossible, causing safety hazards and halting learning.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Core risk motivating the paper (Section 1 Introduction).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Limited scalability of real-world RL experiments due to manual reset bottlenecks\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"manual reset bottleneck in robotics RL\", \"reset-related experiment downtime\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Frequent need for humans to reset environments stops data collection, limiting experiment length and number of concurrently trained agents.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"The introduction stresses that waiting for manual resets, not data collection speed, is the bottleneck (Section 1).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Insufficient safe exploration mechanisms in deep RL\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"unsafe exploration in deep RL\", \"lack of safety constraints during exploration\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Standard deep RL explores without constraints, easily entering dangerous or unrecoverable regions of the state space.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Identified as the mechanism causing both safety failures and reset requirements (Section 1, Section 2 Related Work).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"High frequency of manual environment resets in RL training\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"excessive hard resets\", \"constant manual episode resets\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Because agents cannot reliably recover, humans have to reset after every episode or failure, drastically increasing labour cost.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Described as the immediate operational problem leading to scalability risk (Section 1).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reversible action sequences ensure recoverability in RL\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"reversibility as safety proxy\", \"safety through reversible behaviours\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"If the agent’s actions are reversible, it can always return to the start distribution;
