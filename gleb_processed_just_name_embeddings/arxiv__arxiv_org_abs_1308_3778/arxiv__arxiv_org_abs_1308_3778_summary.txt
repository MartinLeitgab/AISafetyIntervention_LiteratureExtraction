Summary
Data source overview: The paper “Game Theory with Translucent Players” develops a Bayesian-counterfactual model in which each player assigns some probability (ε) that their intended action is leaked. Under “common counterfactual belief of rationality” (CCBR) the usual Prisoner’s-Dilemma defection equilibrium can shift to cooperation; formally, strategies that survive iterated deletion of minimax-dominated strategies and are individually-rational emerge.  
Extraction confidence[82]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper is purely theoretical. To turn its results into AI-safety-relevant interventions we infer how an AI designer could operationalise (1) controlled intention leakage and (2) CCBR-based pruning inside multi-agent RL. Both are labelled Experimental and edge confidences lowered where inference was used.  
Extraction completeness: All reasoning steps—from risks (inefficient multi-agent equilibria) through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, validation theorems, to actionable interventions—are included and interconnected; no orphan nodes remain.  
Key limitations: (i) Validation is theoretical only; no empirical benchmarks. (ii) Interventions may require significant engineering to realise. (iii) Paper’s formalism assumes full knowledge of game pay-offs.



Key limitations: purely theoretical validation, interventions require empirical study, real-world agent observational leakage may pose security issues.
