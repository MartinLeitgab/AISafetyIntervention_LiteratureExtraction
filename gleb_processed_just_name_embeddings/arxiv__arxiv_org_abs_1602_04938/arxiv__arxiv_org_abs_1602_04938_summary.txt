Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces LIME (Local, Interpretable, Model-agnostic Explanations) and SP-LIME (Sub-modular Pick-LIME) as a general framework for producing faithful local explanations for any ML model and for selecting a small, representative set of such explanations. Through simulated and real-user experiments, the authors show that these explanations improve human trust calibration, model debugging, and model selection.  
EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83] – high confidence that the fabric is correct and JSON is well-formed; limited by moderate inference when mapping broad “trust” language into risk formulations.  
Instruction-set improvement: 1) Add an explicit example illustrating how to convert “lack of interpretability/trust” language into AI-safety-style risk nodes; 2) clarify how to treat multiple intertwined design contributions (e.g., LIME + SP-LIME) that share validation evidence; 3) provide guidance for confidence scoring when a single paper supplies mixed qualitative & quantitative evidence.  
Inference strategy justification: Moderate inference (edge confidence 2) was used only to connect the general “trust” framing to concrete AI-safety risks (erroneous human decisions) and to map feature-engineering with LIME to a pre-training intervention. All implementation-level nodes and validation evidence are explicitly described in the paper (edge confidence ≥3).  
Extraction completeness: Every claim that links risks → explanations → validation → intervention was captured; duplicate or isolated nodes were merged/removed. Two parallel causal chains (LIME and SP-LIME) share common risks and validation evidence, forming one connected fabric.  
Key limitations: (a) The paper’s evidence is mostly user-study based, so long-term field validation is lacking (reflected in maturity levels). (b) Some edges rely on the assumption that better calibrated trust directly reduces erroneous decisions; future empirical work could strengthen these links.
