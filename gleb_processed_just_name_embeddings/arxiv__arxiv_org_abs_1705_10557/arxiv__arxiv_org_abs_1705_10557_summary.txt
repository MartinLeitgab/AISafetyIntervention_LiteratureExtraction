Summary:
This paper surveys universal reinforcement-learning (URL) algorithms, analyses their theoretical guarantees and empirical behaviour, and presents an open-source framework (AIXIjs) together with grid-world experiments. Major AI-safety-relevant risks identified are (1) insufficient exploration, (2) brittle dependence on priors, (3) planning intractability, (4) noise-induced distraction, and (5) AIXI’s lack of asymptotic optimality. For each risk the paper describes theoretical insights (e.g. exploration schedules, information-gain utilities, MDL Occam bias), design rationales and concrete mechanisms (BayesExp, KL-KSA, MDL agent, Thompson sampling, Dirichlet models, ρUCT planning) that are empirically or theoretically validated and can be operationalised as interventions.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[81]
The resulting fabric captures every causal-interventional path discussed, decomposes each algorithm into white-box nodes and connects all 39 nodes with 41 evidence-scored edges—no isolated items remain. Confidence is reduced mainly by the need to infer an explicit validation node for BayesExp (the paper references proofs but no experiment).  

How to improve instructions: allow “formal proof” to be explicitly called out as validation evidence, and supply an edge-type example for “refined_by” to clarify its use. Clarify whether multiple interventions may be driven by the same validation evidence to avoid duplication.

Inference strategy justification:
Moderate inference (confidence 2) is flagged only where the paper implies but does not spell out an explicit intervention (e.g. deployment-time restriction on entropy-seeking agents). All other links rely on direct statements or figures in Sections 2.3, 3 and 4.

Extraction completeness:
• Every risk raised in Sections 1-2 is mapped to at least one pathway ending in an actionable intervention.  
• All algorithms (BayesExp, KL-KSA, MDL, TS, Dirichlet model, ρUCT) are decomposed into separate design and implementation nodes, enabling cross-paper merging.  
• All empirical findings in Section 4 are represented as validation nodes.

Key limitations:
• Validation evidence uses small-scale grid-worlds; external generalisability is uncertain.  
• Computational metrics (time/memory) were not reported in detail, thus not captured.  
• Some nodes (e.g. BayesExp proof) rely on earlier cited work rather than this paper’s own experiments.
