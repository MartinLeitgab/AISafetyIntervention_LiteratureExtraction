Summary
Data source overview: The paper introduces Self-Imitation Learning (SIL), an off-policy objective that makes an RL agent imitate its own past high-return decisions. The authors theoretically justify SIL as a form of lower-bound soft Q-learning, implement it on top of actor-critic (A2C) and PPO, and empirically show large gains on sparse-reward Atari and MuJoCo tasks.

Inference strategy justification: All nodes and edges were derived directly from explicit statements or quantitative results in the paper. Moderate inference (confidence = 2) was used only for obvious safety-relevant interventions not explicitly labelled as such (e.g., “combine SIL with count-based bonuses”), and these are flagged accordingly.

Extraction completeness explanation: One connected fabric links the primary risk (“Exploration failure …”) through problem, insight, rationale, mechanisms, multiple strands of validation, and four actionable interventions. Every node has at least one edge; no intervention is linked directly to the risk. Framework components (SIL objective, prioritized replay) are decomposed into white-box nodes.

Key limitations: 1) The paper is performance-oriented; mapping to broader AI-safety risks required light inference. 2) Validation strength ratings use best-available but limited empirical evidence (single-paper results). 3) Inter-paper naming consistency was addressed but may still need global ontology alignment.

Instruction-set improvement suggestion: Provide an explicit mapping from performance-oriented RL research to AI-safety risk categories, to reduce subjective inference when papers do not mention safety directly.
