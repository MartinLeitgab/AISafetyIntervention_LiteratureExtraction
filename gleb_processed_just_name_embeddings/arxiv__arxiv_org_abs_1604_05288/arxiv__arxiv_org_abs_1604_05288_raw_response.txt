The work aims to let AI systems assign reasonable probabilities to the outputs of computations that are too expensive to run, thus avoiding serious decision-making errors.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nInference strategy justification: The paper is wholly theoretical, so all validation evidence nodes rely on formal theorems proved in the text (confidence 4–5).  Interventions had to be moderately inferred (maturity 1–2) because the authors do not discuss deployment; this is marked and edges use confidence 2.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: Every distinct claim on the causal path from the top-level risk (mis-estimating expensive computations) through problem analysis, theoretical insight, design rationale, concrete mechanisms, formal validation, and finally to two actionable (though low-maturity) interventions is captured.  All nodes are inter-connected; no isolated nodes remain.  \nKey limitations: 1) Only theoretical evidence is available—no empirical benchmark. 2) Interventions are early-stage research proposals. 3) Some edge directions (mitigated_by vs enabled_by) required interpretation; different readers might prefer alternative verbs.  \n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n

Provide explicit examples of acceptable edge-verb directionality for each pair of categories; this reduces ambiguity (e.g. whether ‘mitigated_by’ should point from theoretical insight to design rationale or vice-versa).  \n2. Include guidance on handling purely theoretical work where “validation evidence” is exclusively mathematical proof, clarifying typical confidence scores.  \n3. Supply a node-count range relative to data length that is flexible rather than prescriptive, avoiding unnecessary node inflation.  \n4. Clarify whether multiple problem analysis nodes branching from a single risk are encouraged or whether consolidation is preferred."
