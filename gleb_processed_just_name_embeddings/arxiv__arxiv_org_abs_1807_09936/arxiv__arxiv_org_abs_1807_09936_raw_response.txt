MAGAIL extends single-agent GAIL to Markov games by deriving a multi-agent inverse-RL objective and training a generator (joint policy) against per-agent discriminators that encode cooperative / competitive priors, while MACK provides a low-variance natural-gradient optimisation backbone.  Experiments on particle worlds and cooperative control show MAGAIL variants closely match expert performance, demonstrating a practical path to replace brittle hand-crafted reward functions in multi-agent RL.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  \nInference strategy justification: Only moderate inference (confidence 2) was used when linking empirical sections to recommended interventions and when interpreting behaviour-cloning pre-training as a safety-relevant intervention.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All top-level risks discussed in the Introduction (reward mis-specification and training instability) are connected through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms and validation evidence to four actionable interventions, yielding 24 fully-inter-connected nodes (≈1 node / 380 words).  \nKey limitations: 1) The paper does not isolate ablations for BC pre-training or MACK, so validation evidence is shared; edge confidence is therefore 2-3. 2) Safety-specific metrics are not reported; effectiveness of interventions on catastrophic risk remains uncertain.  \n\nJSON knowledge fabric follows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n
