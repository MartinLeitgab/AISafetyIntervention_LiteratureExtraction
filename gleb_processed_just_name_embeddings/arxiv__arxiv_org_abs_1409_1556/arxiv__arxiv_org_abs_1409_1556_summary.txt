Summary Required:
Data source overview: The paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition” (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) investigates how increasing convolutional-network depth with small 3×3 filters, multi-scale data augmentation, multi-scale test inference, and model ensembling reduce ImageNet classification error.  
Extraction CONFIDENCE[86]  
Inference-strategy justification: The paper is empirical; causal-interventional paths were explicitly reconstructed from the authors’ stated motivations, architectural choices, experimental validations, and resulting recommendations. Light inference (marked edge-confidence 2) was only used where the causal link was implicit but well-supported.  
Extraction completeness: All major reasoning chains—from the top-level risk of low large-scale image-classification accuracy through mechanism analyses, theoretical insights, design decisions, implementation techniques, validation results, to actionable interventions—are captured and inter-connected; no isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) The paper is not about AI-safety directly; extracted interventions are model-performance oriented but still relevant to ML safety benchmarking. 2) Some causal wording required moderate inference because authors describe motivations narratively, not formally. 3) Only the most salient interventions were extracted to keep node count within guidance.

JSON follows.



How instructions could be improved: The prompt demands six concept categories in strict order, but many real papers present intertwined or reversed causal reasoning; explicit guidance on acceptable edge directions (allowing ‘caused_by’ edges that move backwards in chain) and concrete examples for performance-oriented ML papers would reduce ambiguity.

Key limitations of extraction: (1) Paper focuses on accuracy, not safety, so relevance to AI safety is indirect. (2) Only four interventions captured; minor techniques (e.g., dropout, multi-GPU) omitted to keep graph concise. (3) Edge confidence subjective without statistical significance values.
