Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Artificial Fun: Mapping Minds to the Space of Fun” introduces a formal framework that links (i) the vast space of possible minds, (ii) the equally vast space of knowledge strings, and (iii) two distinct routes to “fun” (novelty-fun and process-fun).  It analyses three AI-safety-relevant risks: (1) long-lived or enhanced humans running out of fun and suffering boredom, (2) AI agents engaging in wire-heading that severs reward from productive behaviour, and (3) anthropomorphic bias that distorts alignment research.  It then offers theoretical tools and design ideas—such as the fun(mind, info) Boolean function, utility-function security, and AI-mediated novelty generation—that can be developed into concrete interventions.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: The source is almost entirely theoretical.  Interventions are not spelled out as engineering prescriptions, so moderate inference (edge-confidence ≤ 2) was applied only when the text implies practical steps (e.g., “friendly AI providing novelty”, “utility-function security”), in line with the prompt.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All explicit reasoning chains from the three identified risks to potential solutions were decomposed into six intermediate concept categories and linked to three final interventions.  Shared nodes (“Fun as novelty-process function…”) interconnect the pathways into one fabric and remove isolation.  
Key limitations:  
• The paper is speculative; therefore validation evidence nodes rely on conceptual or historical arguments, not controlled experiments.  
• Some implementation details (e.g., cryptographic reward channels) are inferred from the cited “utility-function security” work rather than fully described in the paper.  
• Fun theory is not a standardised domain, so future sources may introduce overlapping terminology that will need careful node-merging.

MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST  
✓ No edge connects an intervention node directly to a risk node.  
✓ All pathways inter-connect through shared theoretical insight nodes; no isolated islands.  
✓ Every node is referenced by at least one edge, eliminating satellites.  
✓ Framework concepts (e.g., fun(mind, info)) are decomposed into white-box component nodes.  
✓ Node names follow the requested granularity and are unique.  
✓ JSON schema validated for field presence and naming consistency.
