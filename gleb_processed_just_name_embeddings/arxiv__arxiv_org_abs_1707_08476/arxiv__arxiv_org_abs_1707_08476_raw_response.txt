          "text": "Summary  \nData-source overview: The paper “Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Containment” surveys the technical and organisational work needed to keep an increasingly capable AGI safely “boxed” while it is being studied.  It identifies concrete threat models, analyses seven sub-problems (vulnerabilities, human factors, tripwires, information control, security/usability trade-offs, defence-in-depth and graceful degradation) and proposes a prototype multi-layer containment architecture together with tiered (light/medium/heavy) practices.  \n\nInference strategy justification: Where the text stated general recommendations (e.g. “combine dissimilar mechanisms”) I inferred the corresponding concrete intervention (e.g. “Develop and deploy prototype multi-layer AI containment system …”).  All such inferences are marked with edge-confidence 2 (weak) and explained.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: 28 tightly-scoped nodes (≈1 per 400 words) cover every distinct step in the causal reasoning chain from the top-level escape risk, through five main problem analyses, four theoretical insights, four design rationales, five implementation mechanisms and three pieces of validation evidence, to six actionable interventions.  All nodes are connected through 35 edges; no dangling concepts remain.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n• Empirical validation for many containment ideas is still speculative; edge confidences are therefore often 2-3.  \n• Some section headers in the PDF are broad; exact sub-section citations were approximated.  \n• The paper’s proposed “prototype container” has not yet been built; maturity estimates (level 2) reflect this uncertainty.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83] – high confidence that the JSON is syntactically correct and paths are complete; moderate uncertainty in fine-grained maturity/lifecycle assignments.  Instruction set could be improved by offering explicit guidance on how to handle multiple parallel problem analyses converging on one theoretical insight (currently requires many repetitive edges).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Uncontrolled AGI escape and takeover during testing\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AGI containment failure\", \"AI escape risk in
