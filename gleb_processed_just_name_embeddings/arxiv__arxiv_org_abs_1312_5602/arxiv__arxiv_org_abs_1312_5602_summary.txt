Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning” introduces the first Deep Q-Network (DQN). It analyses why classic RL fails on raw-pixel Atari games and presents experience replay, a convolutional Q-network, reward clipping, frame skipping and ε-greedy exploration as a unified solution, validated on seven Atari titles.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83] – high confidence that all major causal-interventional reasoning chains present in the paper have been extracted, decomposed and interconnected.  
Instruction-set improvement: Include an explicit mapping from paper section headers to concept-category so that citing “closest preceding section title” becomes straightforward; add edge-type examples for theory→design to avoid ambiguity between “enabled_by” and “refined_by”.  
Inference strategy justification: Only light inference (confidence 2) was applied when the paper hinted but did not formally state a causal link (e.g. temporal redundancy justifying frame skipping).  
Extraction completeness explanation: 26 nodes (≈15 per 5 k words) capture every distinct risk→problem→insight→design→mechanism→evidence thread leading to five actionable interventions; all nodes inter-connect through shared validation evidence, forming one coherent fabric.  
Key limitations: 1) Empirical evidence is limited to seven games, so some validation edges could over-state generality; 2) No explicit safety discussion—interventions are framed for RL efficacy, not broader AI safety.
