          "text": "Summary:\nThe paper introduces the Ranked Reward (R2) algorithm, a reinforcement-learning method that emulates the curriculum benefits of self-play in single-player combinatorial-optimization problems by ranking recent game rewards. A policy-value neural network, guided by Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), is trained with these ranked rewards, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a 2-D bin-packing benchmark.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84]\n\nInstruction-set improvement: The current instructions focus on capturing causal chains but do not explicitly ask for parameter-sensitivity findings (e.g., threshold tuning) to be turned into validation-evidence nodes. Adding a reminder to extract “hyper-parameter sensitivity / ablation findings” would help ensure such insights are never missed. A short glossary of canonical edge verbs with definitions would further reduce naming ambiguity.\n\nInference strategy justification:\nThe paper is optimisation-oriented, not explicitly AI-safety-oriented. Moderate inference was therefore applied to frame poor optimisation performance as a risk relevant to safety-critical industrial applications, and to translate algorithm descriptions into actionable interventions. All inference-based edges were marked with confidence ≤ 3.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation:\nAll reasoning steps that connect the top-level risk (“low-quality combinatorial optimisation”) through the lack of curriculum, the ranked-reward insight, the design and implementation of R2, the empirical findings, and finally to concrete actions (deploy R2, choose 75 % threshold, calibrate thresholds) are represented. No isolated nodes remain and framework names (R2) are decomposed into white-box elements.\n\nKey limitations:\n1. The source only validates on ten-item bin-packing; generalisability remains uncertain.\n2. Real-world deployment constraints (latency, interpretability) are not discussed; these are outside the paper’s scope and therefore absent from the fabric.\n3. Some causal links (risk ⇄ problem analysis) rely on domain inference rather than explicit statements, lowering confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"low-quality solutions in combinatorial optimization for industrial tasks\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"suboptimal combinatorial optimisation outcomes\", \"inefficient industrial optimisation\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Industrial settings rely on NP-hard optimisation (e.g., bin packing);
