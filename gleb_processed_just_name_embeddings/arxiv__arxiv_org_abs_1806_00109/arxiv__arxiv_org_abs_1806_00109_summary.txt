Summary  
Data source overview: The paper proposes a complete pipeline for robots that share physical space with humans: (1) continuously infer a “model-confidence” parameter (β) that indicates how well the robot’s utility-based human-motion model currently explains observed behaviour, (2) produce confidence-aware probabilistic predictions of human motion, and (3) feed these into an extended FaSTrack motion-planning framework that yields a provable probabilistic safety certificate while maintaining efficiency. Extensive simulation (48 real human-trajectory replays) and a hardware quadcopter demonstration show that adaptive β inference outperforms fixed-confidence baselines on both safety (minimum distance) and efficiency (trajectory time).  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
The paper clearly presents two coherent causal chains (prediction confidence and probabilistic planning). Instructions were followed to build connected paths from risk to interventions, decomposing the contributions into white-box components. Remaining uncertainty stems from choosing edge verbs (mitigated_by vs enabled_by) and lifecycle categorisation for robotics algorithms that run online.  

Instruction-set improvement: Add explicit guidance for edge directionality examples between every adjacent concept category to reduce ambiguity (e.g. risk→problem analysis should always use ‘caused_by’, problem analysis→theoretical insight should prefer ‘mitigated_by’).  

Inference strategy justification: Only moderate inference was used to (i) generalise the demonstrated algorithms into deployable interventions and (ii) label maturity (prototype stage) based on the limited scale of experiments. All other nodes and connections are directly grounded in the cited sections.  

Extraction completeness explanation: All claims essential to the safety reasoning (β as confidence, Bayesian inference, FaSTrack bound, probabilistic certificate, validation studies) are captured. Two full causal-interventional chains cover every contribution; shared nodes interconnect the fabric, and no satellites remain. ~14 nodes provide the expected density for the ~10k-word source.  

Key limitations: (1) The validation evidence is still limited in scale; future large-scale field studies are not captured. (2) The fabric does not represent possible multi-human extensions mentioned in future work. (3) Edge confidences are approximate because the paper reports qualitative rather than statistical significance.
