Summary
Data source overview: The paper “Modeling Friends and Foes” proposes an information-theoretic game-theoretic framework in which an environment’s attitude toward an agent is represented by a continuous inverse-temperature parameter β that interpolates smoothly between fully adversarial (β<0) and fully friendly (β>0).  Closed-form Gibbs best-response strategies and a stable iterative algorithm are derived, and a series of bandit and classifier experiments validate that the resulting equilibrium strategies capture non-trivial behaviours, including exploitation, cooperation and variance-driven phase changes.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: Where the paper hinted at downstream safety practice (e.g. online estimation of β) but did not name concrete interventions, moderate inference was applied (confidence level 2) to turn those hints into explicit, actionable AI-safety interventions.  
Extraction completeness: All reasoning chains from the top-level risk (“Exploitation of agent by adversarial environment”) to every method, empirical finding and implied or explicit intervention were captured and interconnected; no isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) Evidence is simulation-only; validation nodes therefore carry medium strengths (3). 2) The interventions are early-stage; real-world scalability remains uncertain. 3) The paper’s future-work ideas (sequential extension, deep nets) are not extracted, staying faithful to present evidence.
