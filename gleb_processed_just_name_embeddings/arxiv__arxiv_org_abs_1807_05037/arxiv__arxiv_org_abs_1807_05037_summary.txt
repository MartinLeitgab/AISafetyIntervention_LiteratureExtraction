Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Exploring Hierarchy-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning” analyses why standard inverse-reinforcement-learning (IRL) procedures mis-infer human preferences when people plan hierarchically. It proposes a Bayesian, Boltzmann-rational, option-aware IRL framework (BIHRL) together with inference algorithms and validates them on Taxi-Driver and Wikispeedia benchmarks.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
Inference strategy justification: Risks, causal mechanisms, theoretical insights, design choices, technical mechanisms, empirical validations and actionable interventions are explicitly mapped from the text, adding only light inference where the paper points at future work (marked low confidence).  
Extraction completeness: All statements that form reasoning chains from mis-specification risk to concrete, reproducible interventions are captured and interconnected; no isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) Empirical evidence is limited to two domains; generalisation edges therefore kept at confidence 3-4. 2) Future-work interventions (variational/HMC scaling) are speculative (confidence 2).  
Instruction-set improvement: Provide an explicit list of accepted edge verbs and require citing paragraph numbers to make “closest preceding section” references unambiguous.
