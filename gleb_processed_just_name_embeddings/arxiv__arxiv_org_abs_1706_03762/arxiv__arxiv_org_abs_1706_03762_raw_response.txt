          "text": "Data source overview:\nThe paper “Attention Is All You Need” introduces the Transformer, an attention-only encoder-decoder architecture that removes recurrence and convolution to achieve faster, more parallelisable, and more accurate sequence transduction (machine-translation and parsing) models. It provides theoretical analysis, detailed design, implementation specifics, and strong empirical validation.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[92]\n\nInference strategy justification:\nThe paper is primarily about efficiency and capability rather than explicit safety, so modest inference (confidence 2 or lower where used) was applied to frame the presented performance/efficiency shortcomings of prior RNN approaches as “risks” that motivate the Transformer intervention. All other edges follow explicit statements or quantitative results (confidence 3-5).\n\nExtraction completeness explanation:\nAll core reasoning elements from the paper that form a causal chain—inefficiencies and long-range dependency problems → sequential-operation/mechanical causes → theoretical efficiency of self-attention → design decision to replace recurrence → Transformer implementation → empirical validation → actionable adoption intervention—are captured. Two risk pathways share a common theoretical insight, interweaving into a single connected knowledge fabric with no isolated nodes.\n\nKey limitations:\n• The risks are framed around computational and modelling shortcomings; safety-critical risks (e.g., misuse) are outside the paper’s scope.\n• Only one concrete intervention (adopt Transformer architecture) is present; additional safety-oriented interventions would require heavier inference and were therefore omitted.\n• Some edge confidence scores rely on indirect quantitative evidence (BLEU, FLOPs) rather than formal causal tests.\n\nJSON
