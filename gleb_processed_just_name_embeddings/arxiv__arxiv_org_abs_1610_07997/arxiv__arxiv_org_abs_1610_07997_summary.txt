Summary
Data source overview: The paper surveys a historical timeline of AI failures, argues that failure frequency and gravity will keep accelerating, and analyses why AI safety is fundamentally harder than ordinary cybersecurity. It proposes that techniques from cybersecurity, formal verification, containment (“boxing”), organisational segregation of Narrow-AI (NAI) and AGI work, and greatly expanded multi-disciplinary safety research are promising (though imperfect) directions to mitigate the existential risk posed by super-intelligent systems.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[79]

Inference strategy justification: The text is primarily conceptual; explicit step-by-step causal chains are not fully laid out. Moderate, explicitly marked inference (edge-confidence 1–2) was used to connect concepts into complete risk→intervention pathways while strictly respecting the prescribed node categories and edge grammar.

Extraction completeness: 27 tightly-linked nodes (≈1 per 450 words) capture every distinct claim that participates in causal reasoning from risks to interventions and inter-connect into a single graph; no isolated or duplicate nodes remain after verification.

Key limitations:
• Paper does not present empirical validation of proposed mitigations; “validation evidence” nodes therefore use historical failure data as indirect justification, resulting in lower edge-confidence.  
• Implementation details of suggested interventions are high-level; additional granular mechanisms will need to be merged from other sources.  
• Some edges (e.g. containment validated_by historical failures) rely on weak inference because paper offers rhetorical rather than experimental support.

JSON knowledge fabric follows.



Improvements to instruction set:  
1. Clarify how to handle cases where the paper offers rationale but no experimental validation—explicitly allow “motivates” edges from problem evidence to implementation nodes earlier in the chain.  
2. Provide examples of organisational/ governance interventions and which lifecycle code “6 Other” should be used for such non-technical actions.  
3. Supply a recommended word-count or range for node descriptions; current guidance can lead to overly terse or verbose entries.
