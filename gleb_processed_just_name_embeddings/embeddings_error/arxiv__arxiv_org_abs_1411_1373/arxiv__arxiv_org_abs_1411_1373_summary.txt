Summary

Data source overview  
The book “Ethical Artificial Intelligence” (Hibbard, 2015) surveys the full risk landscape for advanced AI and proposes a sequence of increasingly technical design interventions: model-based utility functions, statistical learning of human values, three-argument utility functions to avoid reward-generator corruption, a two-stage / self-modelling architecture to keep the utility definition invariant while allowing resource growth, stochastic action options to resist prediction, and a simulation-based decision-support testing environment. Each chapter forms part of a single causal-interventional fabric that runs from top-level risks (instrumental convergence, self-delusion, reward hacking, design inconsistency, embedded-agent vulnerabilities, social-power risks) to concrete, testable interventions.

Inference strategy justification  
All nodes and edges are pulled directly from the text’s named problems (Ch. 5-9) and proposed solutions, with light abstraction only to harmonise terminology across the wider 500 k-source graph (e.g. “self-delusion via reward hacking in RLHF training” → “self-delusion via reward manipulation in AI agents”).  

Extraction completeness  
15 concept nodes and 6 intervention nodes capture every distinct step in the book’s main reasoning chains; all are interconnected in one fabric and traceable to chapter titles.  

Key limitations  
• Validation evidence in the book is largely toy-examples and theoretical, so several edge confidences are 2-3.  
• Only the most central risks and interventions are included due to node-count constraints; some political discussion (Ch. 10-11) is omitted as it does not introduce new causal links.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]

How to improve extraction instructions  
• Specify a maximum node count per risk pathway to aid consistent granularity.  
• Allow “evidence_type” field for edges to tag theoretical vs empirical support.  
• Provide a standard alias list to enforce cross-source naming (e.g. “self-delusion|wireheading”).  

Key limitations of current extraction  
Some rich political discussion (Ch. 10-11) was not converted into separate nodes because it introduces no new technical causal links; future extraction passes aimed at governance may add those.
