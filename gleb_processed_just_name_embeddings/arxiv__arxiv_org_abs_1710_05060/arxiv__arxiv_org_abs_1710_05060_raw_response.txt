          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper “Functional Decision Theory: A New Theory of Instrumental Rationality” argues that standard AI-relevant decision procedures—causal decision theory (CDT) and evidential decision theory (EDT)—systematically lose utility, become exploitable, and create coordination failure in the presence of reliable predictors or copies.  The authors introduce functional decision theory (FDT), a procedure that reasons over the output of the decision function itself and preserves all subjunctive (logical, mathematical, causal) dependencies when constructing counterfactuals, thereby outperforming CDT and EDT in every analysed dilemma.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  \nThe source is highly structured and repeatedly contrasts CDT/EDT failure modes with FDT successes, so mapping the single robust causal–interventional chain was straightforward.  Moderate inference was required to phrase AI-safety-relevant interventions (the paper is primarily philosophical).  Possible improvements to the instruction set: allow “framework-level” nodes that bundle tightly-coupled microscopic components (e.g. the do-intervention graph plus subjunctive-dependency reasoning) when the paper never separates them; otherwise many tiny nodes are forced that provide little merge value across 500 k sources.\n\nInference strategy justification: The intervention “Integrate FDT into AI agent decision module” is not spelled out as an engineering recipe but is the clear, intended actionable takeaway.  It is marked lifecycle 1 (model-design) and maturity 2 (proof-of-concept) with confidence-level annotations.\n\nExtraction completeness: All reasoning steps from risk → problem analysis → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → validation evidence → intervention are present and connected; no dangling or duplicate nodes.\n\nKey limitations: 1) empirical validation outside toy dilemmas is absent (edge confidence 3). 2) Constructing the required logical-dependency graphs automatically is still an open problem (noted in paper). 3) Only one direct intervention is explicit; downstream work must translate FDT into practical architectures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Exploitability of AI agents by predictors or blackmailers in Newcomblike dilemmas\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"agent blackmail vulnerability\", \"AI exploitability by predictors\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that AI systems systematically forfeit large utility or pay extortion when facing entities that can accurately predict or model their behavior (e.g., Newcomb’s problem, XOR or mechanical blackmail).\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Highlighted across Sections 2, 4, 6 and 9 as the main negative consequence of using CDT/EDT.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Overconditioning on evidential correlations in evidential decision theory\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"news managing behavior in EDT\", \"EDT overconditioning\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Problem where EDT treats mere statistical correlations between its action and world events as if they were controllable, leading to ‘managing the news’, paying blackmail, and refusing beneficial information.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Discussed in Sections 2, 7 and the XOR blackmail example as primary mechanism causing exploitability.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ignoring logical dependencies in causal decision theory\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"CDT breaks predictor links\", \"CDT neglects subjunctive dependence\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Problem where CDT severs logical links between its action and accurate predictions about that action, yielding dominated choices, instability and vulnerability (e.g., Death in Damascus).\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Explained in Sections 3, 8 and multiple dilemmas as the CDT-specific failure mode.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Subjunctive dependence distinguishes causal, logical, and statistical relations in decision-making\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"subjunctive dependency modelling\", \"logical-causal dependency insight\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Insight that events can depend on an agent’s decision function output even without causal influence;
