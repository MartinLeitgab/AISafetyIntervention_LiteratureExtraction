Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Functional Decision Theory: A New Theory of Instrumental Rationality” argues that standard AI-relevant decision procedures—causal decision theory (CDT) and evidential decision theory (EDT)—systematically lose utility, become exploitable, and create coordination failure in the presence of reliable predictors or copies.  The authors introduce functional decision theory (FDT), a procedure that reasons over the output of the decision function itself and preserves all subjunctive (logical, mathematical, causal) dependencies when constructing counterfactuals, thereby outperforming CDT and EDT in every analysed dilemma.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
The source is highly structured and repeatedly contrasts CDT/EDT failure modes with FDT successes, so mapping the single robust causal–interventional chain was straightforward.  Moderate inference was required to phrase AI-safety-relevant interventions (the paper is primarily philosophical).  Possible improvements to the instruction set: allow “framework-level” nodes that bundle tightly-coupled microscopic components (e.g. the do-intervention graph plus subjunctive-dependency reasoning) when the paper never separates them; otherwise many tiny nodes are forced that provide little merge value across 500 k sources.

Inference strategy justification: The intervention “Integrate FDT into AI agent decision module” is not spelled out as an engineering recipe but is the clear, intended actionable takeaway.  It is marked lifecycle 1 (model-design) and maturity 2 (proof-of-concept) with confidence-level annotations.

Extraction completeness: All reasoning steps from risk → problem analysis → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → validation evidence → intervention are present and connected; no dangling or duplicate nodes.

Key limitations: 1) empirical validation outside toy dilemmas is absent (edge confidence 3). 2) Constructing the required logical-dependency graphs automatically is still an open problem (noted in paper). 3) Only one direct intervention is explicit; downstream work must translate FDT into practical architectures.
