The authors prove that an agent is asymptotically optimal iff EP→0, derive a MinEP algorithm that greedily minimises expected EP, and show in multi-armed bandit experiments that MinEP explores efficiently and attains low regret.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [83]  \nInference strategy justification: Only minimal, explicitly sign-posted inference was used—mainly to convert the authors’ conceptual contributions into actionable AI-safety-relevant interventions (e.g. “monitor EP to decide when to exploit”).  \nExtraction completeness: All causal paths from the central risk (“inefficient exploration in model-based RL”) through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationale, implementation mechanism, validation evidence and finally to two actionable interventions are captured. Nodes are uniquely named at the recommended granularity and every node is connected.  \nKey limitations: 1) The paper focuses on performance rather than classical x-safety risks, so interventions are framed around efficiency not misalignment. 2) Real-world maturity of EP is low, so edge confidences after the proof/experiment stage drop when projecting to interventions. 3) Only the dominant reasoning pathway is extracted; secondary discussions (alternative EP definitions) were omitted to avoid fragmentation.\n\nJSON below follows the required schema.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"inefficient exploration in model-based reinforcement learning\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"poor exploration in model-based RL\", \"suboptimal exploration in RL\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Using naïve strategies like ε-greedy, model-based RL agents fail to reach sparse rewards quickly, slowing learning and producing sub-optimal policies.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Problem framed in 1 Introduction as the major obstacle for deep RL.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"reward-agnostic exploration strategies in reinforcement learning\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"undirected exploration in RL\", \"ε-greedy exploration issues\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Strategies such as ε-greedy or option discovery ignore the reward landscape, leading to excessive or misplaced exploration in high- or low-value regions.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Discussed in 1 Introduction as a key weakness of current methods.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"over-exploration of low-value regions by information-gain strategies\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"misallocated exploration from information gain\", \"information gain ignores rewards\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Methods maximising environment information gain treat all observations equally, resulting in unnecessary sampling of demonstrably bad actions (e.g. the −1 arm in a Gaussian bandit).\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Explained with the 3-armed bandit example in 1 Introduction.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"reward-directed exploration for asymptotic optimality in reinforcement learning\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"reward-aware exploration necessity\", \"reward-directed exploration insight\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Exploration should be guided by expected rewards;
