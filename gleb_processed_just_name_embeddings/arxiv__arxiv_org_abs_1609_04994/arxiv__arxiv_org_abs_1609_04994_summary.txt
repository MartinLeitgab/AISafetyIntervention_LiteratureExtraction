Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces “exploration potential” (EP), a Bayesian, reward-aware quantity that measures how much exploration an RL agent still needs. The authors prove that an agent is asymptotically optimal iff EP→0, derive a MinEP algorithm that greedily minimises expected EP, and show in multi-armed bandit experiments that MinEP explores efficiently and attains low regret.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [83]  
Inference strategy justification: Only minimal, explicitly sign-posted inference was used—mainly to convert the authors’ conceptual contributions into actionable AI-safety-relevant interventions (e.g. “monitor EP to decide when to exploit”).  
Extraction completeness: All causal paths from the central risk (“inefficient exploration in model-based RL”) through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationale, implementation mechanism, validation evidence and finally to two actionable interventions are captured. Nodes are uniquely named at the recommended granularity and every node is connected.  
Key limitations: 1) The paper focuses on performance rather than classical x-safety risks, so interventions are framed around efficiency not misalignment. 2) Real-world maturity of EP is low, so edge confidences after the proof/experiment stage drop when projecting to interventions. 3) Only the dominant reasoning pathway is extracted; secondary discussions (alternative EP definitions) were omitted to avoid fragmentation.
