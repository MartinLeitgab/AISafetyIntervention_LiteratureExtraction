Summary
Data source overview: The paper introduces OpenAI Gym – a suite of version-controlled RL environments, a public scoreboard with required write-ups and code, and default monitoring to record learning curves – and explains the design reasoning behind each component.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper presents few explicit “risk” or “intervention” phrases. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to map the authors’ stated motivations (e.g. reproducibility problems, over-fitting danger, neglect of sample complexity) to explicit AI-safety-relevant risk statements and to treat Gym features as interventions.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional paths in the text (three main ones) were decomposed into the six required concept categories plus corresponding interventions, yielding an interconnected fabric of 18 nodes and 17 edges.  
Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence is limited to qualitative community adoption comments; 2) No quantitative safety metrics were in the paper, so validation edge confidences are medium; 3) Interventions are evaluation-phase measures, not direct model-control techniques.

JSON knowledge fabric


Suggestions for instruction-set improvement: Clarify whether “caused_by” must be used exactly as in the template even when semantically awkward (risk arguably “results from” problem). Allow “addressed_by” between problem analysis and theoretical insight to better match logical flow and reduce forced inversions. Provide explicit guidance on choosing lifecycle stages for evaluation/benchmarking interventions that are not model-training techniques.
