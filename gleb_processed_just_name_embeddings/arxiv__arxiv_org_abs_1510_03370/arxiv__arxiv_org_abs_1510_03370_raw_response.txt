          "text": "Summary  \nThe paper introduces the AL,T algorithm, a resource-bounded learner that assigns probabilities to logical sentences.  It defines “irreducible patterns” and the generalized Benford test, then proves that AL,T passes this test and converges on provable / disprovable sentences.  These results matter for AI-safety because mis-calibrated logical beliefs in advanced systems can create severe decision-making errors; AL,T and the associated tests supply a principled mitigation strategy.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nThe graph contains one connected fabric from the top-level risk through problem analysis, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms and validation evidence to three actionable interventions.  Every node is referenced by at least one edge, no intervention–risk shortcuts exist, and framework details (AL,T, irreducible patterns, Benford test) are decomposed.  Minor uncertainty: mapping purely mathematical proofs to “validation evidence” and inferring practical interventions required interpretation.\n\nInference strategy justification  \n• Interventions are not explicitly proposed in the text, so moderate inference (confidence 3 or below on relevant edges, maturity ≤ 2) translated the theoretical contributions into plausible AI-safety actions.  \n• Edge confidences reflect proof strength (5 for formal theorems, 3 for inferred applicability).\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nCore reasoning lines (risk → intractability → calibration idea → Benford criterion → irreducible pattern machinery → AL,T algorithm → proofs) are fully captured, with branch links to runtime analysis and dual proofs.  All key concepts enabling downstream cross-paper merging (e.g. “irreducible pattern detection”) are explicitly separate nodes.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Paper is entirely theoretical; no empirical benchmarks exist, so validation evidence is all proofs.  \n• Practical feasibility of interventions is untested; maturity is therefore low.  \n• Some node granularity choices (e.g. runtime bound split) could be debated but keep connectivity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Logical uncertainty miscalibration in resource-bounded AI agents\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"incorrect probability assignment to logical sentences by bounded agents\", \"logical belief miscalibration under computational limits\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"AI systems with limited computation may assign grossly incorrect probabilities to logical statements, leading to unsafe reasoning and decisions.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced implicitly in 1 Introduction as the motivating danger behind logical uncertainty research.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Intractability of computing logical truth under time constraints\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"computational hardness of truth evaluation\", \"time-bounded logical truth intractability\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Exact truth evaluation of most sentences is undecidable or requires infeasible resources, forcing agents to rely on approximations.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Discussed in 1 Introduction and 2 The Benford Test as the core technical barrier causing miscalibration.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Randomness-like sequence calibration for logical uncertainty\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"using statistical regularities for logical uncertainty\", \"calibration via Benford law on logical statements\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"If the truth values of a sentence sequence behave like biased coin flips, a well-calibrated algorithm should match the empirical frequency.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Section 2 introduces Benford’s law as a guiding statistical regularity for assigning probabilities.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Generalized Benford test as calibration criterion for logical uncertainty algorithms\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"generalized Benford calibration test\", \"Benford-based logical uncertainty benchmark\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Extends the simple Benford test to any sequence that forms an irreducible pattern, supplying a universal calibration benchmark.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"design rationale\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Defined formally in Definition 3.3 to translate the theoretical insight into an actionable benchmark.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Irreducible pattern detection within logical sentence sequences\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"irreducible pattern formal definition\", \"statistical test for coin-flip–like logical sequences\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"An irreducible pattern is a sequence whose provability frequency cannot be algorithmically exploited;
