Summary
Data source overview:  
The paper introduces Predictor-Verifier Training (PVT), a framework that jointly trains a task “predictor” network with a second “verifier” network that learns to supply dual variables that certify robustness.  By amortising expensive verification across the dataset, PVT produces models with state-of-the-art provable accuracy against ℓ∞ adversarial attacks on MNIST and SVHN and the first non-trivial bound on CIFAR-10.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84] – I am highly confident the extracted nodes and edges capture every explicit reasoning step from adversarial-misclassification risk through duality insight to the PVT intervention.  Minor uncertainty remains over precise maturity classification (prototype vs experimental).

Instruction-set improvement:  adding an explicit mapping example for edges from multiple parallel problem analyses into a single theoretical insight would help ensure consistent choice of edge verbs (“mitigated_by” vs “addressed_by”).

Inference strategy justification:  Only light inference (confidence 2) was used when connecting experimental evidence to the general recommendation to “apply PVT”; everything else is directly stated.

Extraction completeness:  All claims underpinning PVT are present: the adversarial-misclassification risk, the lack-of-guarantees and computational-overhead mechanisms, the dual-bound theoretical insight, the learnt-verifier design rationale, concrete architectures, empirical validation, and the actionable intervention.

Key limitations:  
1. Paper evaluates only vision benchmarks, so generality across domains is assumed (confidence 2).  
2. Long-term deployment issues (e.g. distributional shift) are outside the paper’s scope and therefore not covered in the fabric.
