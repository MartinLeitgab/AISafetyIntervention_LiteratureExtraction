Summary
Data source overview: The paper critiques standard evaluation practice of semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms and proposes a more realistic methodology. It describes theoretical motivations, design decisions, a unified implementation, and extensive experiments that reveal several pitfalls (e.g., class-distribution mismatch, over-tuned hyper-parameters, inflated SSL gains) and ends with concrete recommendations.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: Risks and causal links are explicit in the text; where the authors imply actionable measures (e.g., “use the exact same model”), these are formalised as interventions. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was employed only when turning narrative recommendations into structured intervention nodes.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains from the overarching risk (“unreliable real-world assessment of SSL”) through problem causes, insights, design rationale, implementation, experimental validation and the five concrete recommended interventions are captured; every node is connected, duplication removed, framework decomposed.  
Key limitations: The paper is methodological, not directly AI-safety-focused; interventions are therefore evaluation-oriented. Edge confidence levels are approximate, based on qualitative descriptions rather than statistical tests. Future instruction improvements: add explicit guidance for methodological papers where “deployment” is evaluation, and clarify confidence assignment for largely qualitative evidence.
