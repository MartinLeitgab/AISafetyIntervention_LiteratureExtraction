Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces the “logical induction criterion”, a market-based method that lets computationally-bounded reasoners assign and update probabilities over logical statements without becoming exploitable by efficient Dutch-book strategies. After motivating the risk of logical non-omniscience and standard probability theory’s failure to handle it, the authors derive a construction of logical inductors and prove a rich set of properties (convergence, limit-coherence, learning of statistical and halting patterns, self-trust, paradox-resistance). These formal results form evidence for using logical induction–style modules inside AI systems that must reason about code, proofs or their own behaviour.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [87]  
The paper states explicit causal reasoning steps and formal theorems, so concept extraction is straightforward. Ambiguity remains on concrete engineering details, lowering confidence slightly.  

Inference strategy justification: The text provides risks, analyses, theoretical insights, design principles, mechanisms and proofs. Only the concrete “interventions” for AI safety are implicit; I inferred two pragmatic interventions that an AI-safety engineer would naturally draw from these results, marking edges with confidence 2.  

Extraction completeness: Every concept appearing in at least one formal causal chain from risks to interventions is captured; all nodes are interconnected, and no direct risk→intervention edges exist. Framework components (logical induction) are decomposed into rationale and mechanisms.  

Key limitations: (1) Validation evidence is theoretical, not empirical. (2) Real-world scaling issues are not discussed, so intervention maturity remains low. (3) Some edges rely on moderate inference about downstream AI-safety applications.



Improvements to instruction set:  
1. Clarify whether theoretical proofs count as “validation evidence” or should be split into separate nodes per theorem; current rules favour compact grouping.  
2. Provide explicit guidance on handling papers that mainly contribute formal theorems, including how to rate evidence confidence when empirical data is absent.  
3. Add examples for inferring practical interventions from abstract theory so maturity and lifecycle tagging become more consistent.
