          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper introduces the “logical induction criterion”, a market-based method that lets computationally-bounded reasoners assign and update probabilities over logical statements without becoming exploitable by efficient Dutch-book strategies. After motivating the risk of logical non-omniscience and standard probability theory’s failure to handle it, the authors derive a construction of logical inductors and prove a rich set of properties (convergence, limit-coherence, learning of statistical and halting patterns, self-trust, paradox-resistance). These formal results form evidence for using logical induction–style modules inside AI systems that must reason about code, proofs or their own behaviour.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [87]  \nThe paper states explicit causal reasoning steps and formal theorems, so concept extraction is straightforward. Ambiguity remains on concrete engineering details, lowering confidence slightly.  \n\nInference strategy justification: The text provides risks, analyses, theoretical insights, design principles, mechanisms and proofs. Only the concrete “interventions” for AI safety are implicit; I inferred two pragmatic interventions that an AI-safety engineer would naturally draw from these results, marking edges with confidence 2.  \n\nExtraction completeness: Every concept appearing in at least one formal causal chain from risks to interventions is captured; all nodes are interconnected, and no direct risk→intervention edges exist. Framework components (logical induction) are decomposed into rationale and mechanisms.  \n\nKey limitations: (1) Validation evidence is theoretical, not empirical. (2) Real-world scaling issues are not discussed, so intervention maturity remains low. (3) Some edges rely on moderate inference about downstream AI-safety applications.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Logical non-omniscience in bounded AI reasoners\",\n
