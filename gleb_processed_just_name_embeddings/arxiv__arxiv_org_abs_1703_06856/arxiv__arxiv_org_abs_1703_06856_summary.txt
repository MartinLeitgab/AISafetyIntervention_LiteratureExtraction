Summary  
Data source overview: The paper “Counterfactual Fairness” introduces a causal-inference based definition of algorithmic fairness that requires a model’s prediction distribution for an individual to be invariant under counterfactual changes to protected attributes. It analyses why popular statistical fairness criteria can perpetuate discrimination, proposes design principles for building counterfactually-fair predictors, details concrete implementation mechanisms (latent-variable inference, additive-noise residualization, twin-network audits) and validates them analytically and empirically on law-school-admission and NYPD stop-and-frisk data.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: All nodes are anchored in explicit claims, methods, experiments or logical lemmas in the paper. Moderate inference (confidence 2) is only used to convert general prescriptions into concrete intervention actions for an AI-development lifecycle stage.  
Extraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning step that links the top-level risks (algorithmic discrimination & historical-bias amplification) to the two actionable interventions (train with counterfactual fairness; audit with twin-network tests) is captured through connected concept nodes that represent problem analyses, causal insights, design rationales, mechanisms and validation evidence. All paths are inter-connected; no isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) The paper focuses on supervised-learning fairness; transferability to reinforcement-learning or generative-model settings is not covered. 2) Validation evidence is limited to two real datasets and one synthetic proof, so maturity of interventions is experimental. 3) Some causal-model assumptions are not empirically verifiable; edges relying on them are assigned lower confidence.

JSON knowledge fabric follows.



Potential instruction-set improvements  
1. Allow grouping multiple small but closely related validation findings into a single node to reduce node count without losing reasoning granularity.  
2. Provide explicit guidance on how to decide the intervention_lifecycle stage for fairness methods that span both training and evaluation.  
3. Clarify whether design-rationale nodes may have multiple implementation-mechanism edges and recommend edge confidence aggregation when several mechanisms jointly implement the design.
