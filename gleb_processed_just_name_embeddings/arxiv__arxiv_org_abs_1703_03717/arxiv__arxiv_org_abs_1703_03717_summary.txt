Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces “Right for the Right Reasons” (RRR), a method for training differentiable models so they depend on the intended features instead of hidden confounds. It proposes penalising input-gradient explanations in the loss and, when annotations are absent, an iterative “find-another-explanation” procedure that successively blocks previously-used features. Experiments on toy and real datasets (Decoy-MNIST, Iris-Cancer, 20 Newsgroups) show that these mechanisms improve out-of-distribution generalisation, discover alternative rules, and generate explanations faster than LIME.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  
Inference strategy justification: All nodes were created by following the mandated causal chain (risk → problem analysis → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → validation evidence → intervention). Only moderate inference (confidence 2) was used when the paper implied but did not explicitly label causal links (e.g. mapping “generalization gaps” to “mis-generalisation risk”).  
Extraction completeness: Every distinct claim that participates in the reasoning fabric has been captured (18 nodes, 18 edges). Nodes are named so they can merge cleanly with other sources (e.g. “input-gradient explanations” rather than paper-specific acronyms). All pathways are connected; no isolated nodes exist.  
Key limitations: 1) The paper does not present formal statistical significance, so some edge confidences remain medium (3-4). 2) The interventions are still experimental; real-world deployment data are missing. 3) The node/edge confidence scheme could be enriched with numeric effect sizes for stronger downstream analysis.
