Summary  
Data source overview: The paper analyzes “ontological crises” that occur when a decision-theoretic AI agent replaces its internal world-model (ontology) and can no longer evaluate its original utility function. It proposes a concrete translation method for finite-state ontologies that minimizes KL-divergence while approximating bisimulation, demonstrates it on a corridor example, and discusses implications for safe agent design.  
Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – Reasonably high: the source is conceptually clear, the resulting fabric follows every mandated category and inter-links all nodes. Moderate uncertainty stems from interpreting some implicit design choices (confidence edges 3) and selecting one principal intervention node.  
Inference strategy justification: Only light inference was needed—principally in formulating the explicit safety intervention (“Integrate ontology-mapping algorithm …”) that the paper implies but does not package as a policy step. All other nodes map directly to explicit text.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional pathways from the single risk of value misalignment through problem analysis, theoretical insight, design rationale, concrete implementation, empirical validation, and the resulting intervention are captured in a single connected fabric. No isolated or duplicate nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) Paper supplies only a toy example, so validation evidence remains limited. 2) Scalability to large or continuous ontologies is recognised but unaddressed; this is not modelled as a separate intervention because no concrete method is offered. 3) Edge confidence is qualitative; downstream users should verify empirical rigor.



Improvements to instruction set: Providing a fixed list of canonical edge verbs with precise definitions and recommending default confidences for common textual evidence patterns (e.g., “worked example only” → 4) would reduce subjective variance. Clarifying whether multiple risks per source must always be extracted or whether grouping is acceptable would aid consistency.
