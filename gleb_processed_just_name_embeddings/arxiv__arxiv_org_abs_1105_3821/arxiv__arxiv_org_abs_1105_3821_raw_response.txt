It proposes a concrete translation method for finite-state ontologies that minimizes KL-divergence while approximating bisimulation, demonstrates it on a corridor example, and discusses implications for safe agent design.  \nReport EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – Reasonably high: the source is conceptually clear, the resulting fabric follows every mandated category and inter-links all nodes. Moderate uncertainty stems from interpreting some implicit design choices (confidence edges 3) and selecting one principal intervention node.  \nInference strategy justification: Only light inference was needed—principally in formulating the explicit safety intervention (“Integrate ontology-mapping algorithm …”) that the paper implies but does not package as a policy step. All other nodes map directly to explicit text.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional pathways from the single risk of value misalignment through problem analysis, theoretical insight, design rationale, concrete implementation, empirical validation, and the resulting intervention are captured in a single connected fabric. No isolated or duplicate nodes remain.  \nKey limitations: 1) Paper supplies only a toy example, so validation evidence remains limited. 2) Scalability to large or continuous ontologies is recognised but unaddressed; this is not modelled as a separate intervention because no concrete method is offered. 3) Edge confidence is qualitative; downstream users should verify empirical rigor.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Value misalignment from ontological crises in AI agents\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"ontological crisis value misalignment\", \"goal corruption from ontology upgrade\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that an agent’s original utility function loses its intended meaning after the agent upgrades or replaces its ontology, potentially leading to actions misaligned with designer goals.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced in Abstract & Introduction as the top-level safety concern motivating the paper.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ontology replacement makes predefined utility functions ill-defined\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"utility undefined in new ontology\", \"goal specification breakdown on model change\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"When an agent adopts a more accurate or learned ontology, the states or objects referenced by its original utility function may not exist or map cleanly, preventing evaluation of utility in the new model.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Detailed in Introduction (classical-to-quantum example) as the concrete mechanism causing the risk.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Utility function translation via stochastic ontology mapping\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"probabilistic state mapping\", \"stochastic function ϕ between ontologies\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Proposes resolving the crisis by composing the original utility with a stochastic mapping ϕ that converts states of the new ontology into probability distributions over states of the old ontology.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Outlined in ‘Maps between Ontologies’ as the core theoretical solution.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Optimizing ontology mappings to approximate isomorphism using bisimulation and KL divergence\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"approximate isomorphism criterion\", \"bisimulation-KL optimisation\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Design choice to jointly optimise ϕ and its pseudo-inverse ϕ⁻¹ so that each ontology can simulate the other, minimising KL divergence across transition and output matrices, thereby making ϕ as close to an isomorphism as possible.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"design rationale\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Presented in ‘Maps between Ontologies’ as the reasoning that justifies the chosen optimisation objective.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Hill-climbing optimization of mapping functions in finite state models\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"finite-state hill-climb mapping search\", \"ϕ/ϕ⁻¹ hill-climbing algorithm\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Implements the design by representing ontologies as finite-state hidden-Markov models (transition and output matrices) and employing a simple hill-climbing algorithm to search for ϕ and ϕ⁻¹ that minimise the objective.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"implementation mechanism\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Described in ‘Finite State Models’ and used operationally in the corridor experiment.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Long corridor example demonstrates mapping preserves right-end goal\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"five-state corridor validation\", \"ϕ corridor experiment outcome\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Toy scenario where a four-state corridor utility (‘stand at right end’) is translated to a five-state ontology;

Clarifying whether multiple risks per source must always be extracted or whether grouping is acceptable would aid consistency."
