Summary  
Data source overview: This 11-page research paper introduces “dynamic safe interruptibility” for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement-learning (RL) systems. It proves—in a fully theoretical manner—when and how agents can be trained so that their learned policies and value functions do not depend on human-triggered interruptions, thereby maintaining human control. The work identifies failure modes, derives two key sufficient conditions (infinite exploration and interruption-independent learning updates), proposes concrete design/implementation techniques (compatible ε-schedules, neutral Q-learning, joint-action learning, an interruption flag plus experience pruning), and provides formal theorems validating these techniques.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  
• Formal definitions and theorems give high-clarity causal chains.  
• Paper is purely theoretical; no empirical results, so evidence strengths capped at 4.  
• Node count (22) balances completeness and granularity for ~7 800-word text.  
Instruction-set improvement: add explicit guidance on mapping formal theorems to “validation evidence” nodes and on representing purely mathematical proofs as validation with confidence 4–5.

Inference strategy justification  
Only light inference (confidence 2) was needed to re-express suggested techniques as explicit interventions suitable for the AI-safety lifecycle. All other edges follow directly from definitions, theorems and example scenarios.

Extraction completeness explanation  
All articulated risks (unsafe interruption avoidance & operator manipulation) and every method (ε-compatible exploration, neutral learning, joint-action learners, PINT pruning) appear as concept nodes. Every theorem validating these methods is represented. All interventions flow from validation evidence, satisfying the mandated risk→…→intervention pathways. No isolated nodes remain.

Key limitations  
• Paper’s proofs are abstract; real-world efficacy is untested.  
• Future-work suggestions (neural networks, experience replay) are not formalized enough to warrant intervention nodes, so they were omitted.  
• Confidence edges rely on theoretical reasoning; empirical confirmation is absent.
