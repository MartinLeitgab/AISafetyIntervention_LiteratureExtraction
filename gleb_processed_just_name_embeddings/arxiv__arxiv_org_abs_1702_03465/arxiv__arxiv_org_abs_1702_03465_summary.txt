Summary:
The paper presents an “algorithmic teaching” framework that selects robot‐behavior examples which maximally inform human users about the robot’s underlying reward (objective) function.  By explicitly modelling the approximate way in which humans perform inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and by ensuring demonstration coverage over all high-level driving strategies, the authors show—via simulation and two Mechanical-Turk studies—that users can more accurately anticipate an autonomous car’s actions in novel scenarios.  The extraction below links the safety risk of unexpected robot behaviour to two concrete, partially-validated interventions: (1) selecting examples with a deterministic Euclidean-based user model and (2) augmenting those examples to cover all strategy clusters.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]
The paper gives clear causal chains from risk to validation; terminology is well-matched to canonical wording; edges were cross-checked for completeness and directionality.  Minor ambiguity remains in mapping the “training phase for end-users” to the deployment lifecycle stage.

Instruction-set improvement: provide explicit examples for mapping human-teaching interventions to the 1-6 lifecycle scale; clarify whether “required_by” vs “enabled_by” should point toward or away from the prerequisite node when both readings are reasonable.

Inference strategy justification:
Only light, direct inference was needed (edge directions, lifecycle assignment).  All interventions and connections are explicitly grounded in the text.

Extraction completeness explanation:
All principal reasoning elements (risk, opacity problem, approximate inference insight, algorithmic-teaching design, greedy selection & coverage mechanisms, user-study validation, resulting interventions) are captured and inter-connected; every node participates in at least one path from the risk to an intervention.

Key limitations:
• Results limited to simulated driving; generalisation to other domains unproven.  
• User studies use MTurk participants rather than professional drivers, lowering ecological validity.  
• The intervention maturity is prototype-level only.
