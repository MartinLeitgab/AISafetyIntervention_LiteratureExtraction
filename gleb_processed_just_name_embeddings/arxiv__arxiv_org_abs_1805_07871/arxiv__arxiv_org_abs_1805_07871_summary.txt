Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces I2RL, a formal framework for doing inverse-reinforcement-learning (IRL) in an online setting, and proposes an Incremental Latent Max-Entropy (incremental-LME) algorithm that can infer an expert’s reward function from streaming, partially-observable trajectories.  It proves monotone-likelihood and probabilistic-convergence guarantees and shows experimentally that incremental-LME achieves similar accuracy but ~4× lower run-time and higher task success than the prior batch LME on a robot perimeter-patrol domain.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: All reasoning chains in the paper run from the safety-relevant risk (“reward-mis-estimation in online, occluded environments”) through computational and observability problems, via theoretical insights (incremental updates, latent-variable expectations), to the design (I2RL framework, latent MaxEnt formulation), to concrete mechanisms (incremental LME algorithm, stopping rule, sampling over hidden data) that are validated both theoretically and empirically, and finally to three actionable interventions.  Where the paper provided explicit math/experiments, edge confidence=3–4; light inference (e.g. mapping to AI-safety terminology) is marked confidence = 2.  

Extraction completeness: 14 tightly connected nodes (≈1 per 430 words) capture every distinct claim used in the core arguments; all are inter-connected into a single fabric, with no dangling nodes, and node names are canonicalised for cross-source merging.  

Key limitations:  
1. Only one empirical domain was tested; external validity remains uncertain.  
2. Effectiveness of interventions against deceptive or adversarial experts is not analysed.  
3. Implementation details such as hyper-parameter sensitivity not fully specified here.

Improvements to instructions: Explicitly clarifying whether edge direction should always flow from earlier to later concept categories would prevent ambiguity when using verbs like “enabled_by” or “required_by.”  Adding a canonical list of acceptable edge directions for each pair of node categories would reduce possible mis-interpretation and increase automatic merger quality.
