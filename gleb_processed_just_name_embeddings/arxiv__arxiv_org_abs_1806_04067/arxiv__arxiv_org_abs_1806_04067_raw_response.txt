          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper proposes “Adaptive Mechanism Design”, introducing a separate “planning agent” that distributes additional rewards or punishments to learning agents engaged in matrix-game social dilemmas. By explicitly anticipating how incentives will alter the other agents’ next policy-gradient step, the planning agent reshapes the payoff landscape so that the learners converge to mutual cooperation, greatly increasing social welfare. Experiments on Prisoner’s Dilemma, Chicken, Stag-Hunt, and a 10-player PD confirm near-perfect cooperation, show how costs diminish over time, and identify when the planning agent can be safely removed or constrained to revenue-neutral redistribution.\n\nInference strategy justification: All extracted interventions are explicitly described or directly implied by experimental manipulations (e.g., turning the planning agent off, enforcing revenue-neutrality, using opponent-modeling). Moderate inference (edge confidence = 2) was only used to connect broad risks with underlying incentive problems that are standard in social-dilemma theory.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional pathways from the primary risk (“escalation of conflicts between artificial agents”) through selfish-incentive analyses, mechanism-design theory, planning-agent design rationales, concrete implementation mechanisms, experimental validations, and finally to four actionable interventions are represented. Nodes are at merge-ready granularity and share common terminology with wider AI-safety literature (e.g., “planning agent”, “opponent modeling”, “revenue-neutral reward redistribution”).\n\nKey limitations: The source focuses on small matrix-game settings; generalisation to large-scale, real-world environments is untested. Validation evidence is simulation-based, so confidence ratings are ≤ 4. Interventions B–D inherit these limitations and remain at experimental maturity.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]\n\nHow to improve this extraction instruction set: 1) Clarify whether cost-containment variations (like revenue-neutrality) should be treated as separate interventions or refinements of the same intervention node; 2) Provide an explicit example of handling multiple validation evidences converging on the same intervention to avoid node proliferation; 3) Specify whether the string \"null\" or the JSON null literal should be used for non-applicable attributes to eliminate ambiguity.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"escalation of conflicts between artificial agents in safety-critical systems\",\n      \"aliases\":
