Summary
Data source overview: The paper introduces Multi-Motivation Behaviour Modelling (MMBM), a two-step inverse-reinforcement-learning framework that (1) learns a separate deep-Q-network for each hypothesised human motivation and (2) solves a linear program to infer the weights over these reward dimensions, enabling accurate imitation and analysis of player behaviour in World-of-Warcraft logs without access to a simulator.  
Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper is not explicitly about AI-safety. Risks are therefore inferred from the undesirable consequences highlighted by the authors (e.g. poor behavioural prediction and limited IRL applicability) that are safety-relevant when deploying AI systems that interact with humans. Interventions are directly grounded in the MMBM method and marked as experimental (maturity 2).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains from the identified risks through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence and finally to actionable interventions are captured. Two interconnected risk pathways share common downstream nodes, forming a single connected fabric.  
Key limitations: 1) The original paper does not present safety-focused metrics; risk framing is therefore moderately inferred. 2) Validation evidence is based on a single dataset. 3) Interventions are research-prototype level and may not generalise beyond similar domains.



Key verification checklist:
✓ No intervention node connects directly to a risk node.  
✓ All nodes participate in at least one edge; no duplicates or isolates.  
✓ Framework (MMBM) decomposed into design and implementation components.  
✓ Node names follow specified granularity and are consistent.  
✓ JSON structure validated for matching node names and correct fields.
