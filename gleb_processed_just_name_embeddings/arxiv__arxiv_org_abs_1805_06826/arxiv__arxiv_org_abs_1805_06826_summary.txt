Summary
Data source overview:  The paper “The Blessings of Multiple Causes” introduces the deconfounder, a three-stage procedure (factor modelling → substitute-confounder inference → outcome modelling) that enables unbiased causal inference from observational data with many simultaneous causes.  It shows—through theory and three empirical studies—that modelling the joint assignment of causes with a latent-variable factor model, validating this model with predictive checks and then conditioning on the inferred latent variable dramatically reduces confounding bias compared with classical methods.

Inference strategy justification:  All causal-interventional reasoning steps explicitly appear in the paper: the risk of biased estimates, the mechanism (unobserved multi-cause confounders), the theoretical insight (conditional independence given a latent variable), the design (infer a substitute confounder and validate it), concrete implementation mechanisms (probabilistic factor models, posterior expectations, predictive checks) and validation evidence (GWAS RMSE drop; smoking study bias drop).  Interventions were extracted directly or with light inference (edge-confidence 2) when the paper implied a recommended action but did not phrase it as an explicit prescription (e.g., “pick the smallest factor model that passes checks”).

Extraction completeness explanation:  Every distinct step used to justify the deconfounder and its auxiliary recommendations is represented as a node, and all nodes form one connected fabric from top-level risk to four actionable interventions.  No isolated nodes remain.

Key limitations:  1) empirical evidence is limited to three studies—generalisation strength was set to “4 Strong” only when two studies supported the same claim; 2) interventions such as “merge highly correlated causes” were inferred (confidence 2) rather than directly stated; 3) fine-grained implementation details (choice of variational inference algorithm, hyper-parameters) are outside extraction scope.

Instruction-set improvement suggestions:  
• Clarify whether edges like “refined_by” or “enabled_by” are preferred for linking successive theoretical insights vs. implementation steps—currently examples mix them;  
• Provide explicit guidance on how to encode multiple validation evidence nodes that support the same implementation mechanism to avoid edge proliferation;  
• State whether interventions that merely refine another intervention (e.g. “select smallest adequate model”) should be separate intervention nodes or sub-attributes of the parent intervention.
