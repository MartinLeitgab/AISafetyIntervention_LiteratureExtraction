Summary  
Data source overview: The paper empirically analyses “variational option discovery” (VALOR, VIC, DIAYN) – unsupervised reinforcement-learning methods that learn diverse skills without task rewards. Two core algorithmic innovations are introduced: (1) VALOR’s trajectory-level, state-only decoder and (2) a curriculum that enlarges the context set when the decoder becomes accurate. Extensive experiments show that these design choices mitigate training instability, encourage meaningful dynamical skills, and can transfer to downstream hierarchical control.

Extraction confidence[86]  
Inference strategy justification: All risks and interventions were explicitly discussed or strongly implied. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was used only to translate research choices (e.g. “decoder omits actions”) into AI-safety-relevant interventions (e.g. “prevent trivial context signalling”).  
Extraction completeness: Every causal path from each identified risk to each intervention appearing in the paper is represented through the six required concept categories, with shared nodes ensuring an integrated fabric.  
Key limitations: 1) Results are single-paper, small-seed experiments, so validation edge confidence never exceeds 4. 2) Broader AI-safety implications (e.g. reward hacking) are outside the paper’s scope and are therefore not included.  
Prompt improvement: Allow optional “evidence_location” attribute for quicker provenance retrieval and permit citing equation numbers directly for mechanistic nodes.
