Summary
Data source overview: The paper “Accounting for the Neglected Dimensions of AI Progress” argues that today’s AI benchmarks over-focus on single-number performance metrics. This leads to distorted research incentives, hidden system costs, and overlooked societal externalities. The authors propose evaluating AI systems with multi-dimensional utility functions that include resource use (compute, data, human labour, etc.), mapping systems onto Pareto fronts, and encouraging reproducibility through open leaderboards. Two case studies (Alpha* and ALE) illustrate how adding resource dimensions changes conclusions about progress.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper is conceptual and policy-oriented, so interventions are not spelled out as engineering steps. I applied light inference (edge confidence 2) to convert the authors’ recommendations into safety-relevant, actionable interventions while keeping terminology consistent with the text (e.g., “multi-dimensional AI benchmarks”, “open leaderboards”).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All causal paths from the two top-level risks (misallocation of research resources, unaccounted societal externalities) through problems, insights, rationales, mechanisms, and validation evidence to four concrete interventions are captured. Nodes are uniquely named and inter-connected; no islands remain.  
Key limitations: The paper offers qualitative evidence, so some edge confidences are necessarily medium or weak. Implementation maturity levels are estimated from current community practice rather than explicit statements.

How to improve this instruction set: The current guidelines are thorough but extremely dense. A concise “cheat-sheet” enumerating required node fields, allowed edge verbs, and the mandatory risk→…→intervention ordering would reduce cognitive load and error rate. Providing a minimal working JSON example and a validation script could further decrease formatting mistakes. Explicit clarification on whether multiple theoretical insights may branch directly to multiple design rationales would also help.
