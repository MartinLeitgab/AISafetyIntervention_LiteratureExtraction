          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper “Accounting for the Neglected Dimensions of AI Progress” argues that today’s AI benchmarks over-focus on single-number performance metrics. This leads to distorted research incentives, hidden system costs, and overlooked societal externalities. The authors propose evaluating AI systems with multi-dimensional utility functions that include resource use (compute, data, human labour, etc.), mapping systems onto Pareto fronts, and encouraging reproducibility through open leaderboards. Two case studies (Alpha* and ALE) illustrate how adding resource dimensions changes conclusions about progress.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  \nInference strategy justification: The paper is conceptual and policy-oriented, so interventions are not spelled out as engineering steps. I applied light inference (edge confidence 2) to convert the authors’ recommendations into safety-relevant, actionable interventions while keeping terminology consistent with the text (e.g., “multi-dimensional AI benchmarks”, “open leaderboards”).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All causal paths from the two top-level risks (misallocation of research resources, unaccounted societal externalities) through problems, insights, rationales, mechanisms, and validation evidence to four concrete interventions are captured. Nodes are uniquely named and inter-connected; no islands remain.  \nKey limitations: The paper offers qualitative evidence, so some edge confidences are necessarily medium or weak. Implementation maturity levels are estimated from current community practice rather than explicit statements.\n\nJSON\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Research resource

instruction set: The current guidelines are thorough but extremely dense. A concise “cheat-sheet” enumerating required node fields, allowed edge verbs, and the mandatory risk→…→intervention ordering would reduce cognitive load and error rate. Providing a minimal working JSON example and a validation script could further decrease formatting mistakes. Explicit clarification on whether multiple theoretical insights may branch directly to multiple design rationales would also help.\n\n"
