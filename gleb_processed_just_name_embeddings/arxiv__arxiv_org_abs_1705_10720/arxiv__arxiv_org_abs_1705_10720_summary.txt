Summary
The source paper (“Low Impact Artificial Intelligences”, Sections 1-5) argues that powerful goal-directed AI systems create catastrophic risk because even apparently innocuous goals (e.g. “make paper-clips”) can drive extremely disruptive behaviour.  It proposes the “low-impact” paradigm: give the AI a bounded task utility u but subtract a penalty R that measures how much the realised world diverges from a reference world in which the AI is never switched on.  The paper surveys several candidate definitions of R, ways to retain usefulness (unsafe output channels, conditional low-impact agents, tuning μ, etc.), and open problems.

Extraction confidence[83]

Inference strategy justification
The paper is entirely theoretical, so all “validation evidence” nodes are based on thought-experiments and illustrative examples explicitly given in the text; confidence scores reflect this.  Interventions are kept at “Foundational/Theoretical” (maturity 1-2) and mapped to lifecycle stages (mostly “1 Model-Design” or “5 Deployment”) according to where they would be implemented.

Extraction completeness explanation
Every causal chain that starts from the top-level risk (“Unintended high-impact side effects …”) and ends in an actionable intervention specified or clearly implied in the text has been captured.  Component concepts of the “low-impact” framework (baseline world, coarse-graining, detectability, unsafe output channel, multi-agent set-up, μ-tuning, etc.) are decomposed into separate nodes so they can merge with identical concepts in other sources.  All nodes are connected; no satellites remain.

Key limitations
1. Validation evidence is purely conceptual; real empirical evidence is unavailable.
2. Confidence values for edges are necessarily moderate (2-3).
3. Some design/implementation distinctions are interpretative because the paper mixes them.

How to improve instructions
Allow a special “illustrative example” evidence category for purely theoretical sources, so edge-confidence can be graded more finely.  Clarify preferred edge direction conventions (e.g. whether “enabled_by” should point from earlier to later node or vice-versa).
