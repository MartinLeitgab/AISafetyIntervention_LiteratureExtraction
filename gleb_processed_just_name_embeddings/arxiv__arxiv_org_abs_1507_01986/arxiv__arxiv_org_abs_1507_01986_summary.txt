Summary
Data source overview:  
The paper “Toward Idealized Decision Theory” surveys why the two dominant decision-making formalisms—evidential decision theory (EDT) and causal decision theory (CDT)—fail to guarantee safe behaviour for highly-capable, potentially self-modifying AI systems. It analyses a series of thought-experiment “blackmail” and “Newcomblike” scenarios, introduces the notions of optimisation-target drift, policy selection and logical counterfactuals, and proposes updateless decision theory (UDT) together with two candidate implementations (graphical and proof-based) plus an “indirect normativity” fallback.  

Inference strategy justification:  
The source is conceptual; no empirical data exist. Nodes and edges therefore rely on the paper’s explicit logical arguments (confidence 3) and minimal, clearly-flagged inference (confidence 2) when turning research directions into actionable interventions.  

Extraction completeness explanation:  
20 nodes capture every distinct claim that forms a causal–interventional chain from the top-level AI-catastrophe risk down to concrete research or design interventions. All components (risks, problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence, interventions) are linked, forming one connected knowledge fabric without orphan nodes.  

Key limitations:  
• Validation evidence is purely hypothetical, limiting edge strength.  
• Implementation nodes are early-stage; operational details are still missing in the literature.  
• Some edges connecting broad theoretical insights to specific interventions use light inference (confidence ≤2).  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
(High structural confidence; medium confidence on exact edge verb choice given conceptual nature.)

How the instruction set could be improved:  
1. Provide an explicit example mapping purely theoretical papers (with no empirical results) so practitioners see acceptable confidence scoring for such cases.  
2. Clarify preferred edge verbs for “concept fixes concept” relations (addressed_by vs mitigated_by) to reduce ambiguity.  
3. Supply a short glossary of lifecycle phase 6 (“Other”) use-cases.
