Summary
Data source overview: The paper “Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks” (Sutskever et al., 2014) introduces a 4-layer encoder/decoder LSTM architecture that (1) reverses source sentences, (2) clips exploding gradients and (3) optionally rescors SMT n-best lists.  It demonstrates state-of-the-art BLEU on the WMT’14 En-Fr task and shows robustness on long sentences.

Extraction confidence[86]

Inference-strategy justification:  All nodes and edges follow the mandated six-stage causal flow.  Where the paper does not explicitly label “risks”, moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to phrase empirical shortcomings (e.g. long-sentence degradation, exploding gradients) as safety-relevant risks.  

Extraction completeness:  21 interconnected nodes (≈15/5k words) capture every distinct claim needed for the core reasoning paths.  Three interventions (model design, data preprocessing, training stabilisation) are covered and linked to shared implementation nodes, eliminating isolation.

Key limitations:  1) Paper is not written from a safety vantage; some risk framing is inferred. 2) BLEU is the only validation metric; no independent replication. 3) SMT-rescoring intervention is omitted because it duplicates design ideas without new safety-relevant rationale.

Instruction-set improvement suggestions:  Supply an explicit list of preferred risk categories for non-safety papers; clarify whether “required_by” can bridge implementation mechanisms; and provide examples of how to merge gradient-stabilisation techniques into other fabrics.
