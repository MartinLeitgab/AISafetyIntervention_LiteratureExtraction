          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper introduces the “gluing task”, an interactive tower-stabilisation problem used to study how relational inductive bias affects learning. Human performance is benchmarked against several deep-RL agents: an MLP (no relational structure), two graph-network (GN) agents (fully-connected vs. sparse contact graphs), and a model-based simulation agent that runs Mujoco rollouts. Results show that (1) absence of relational bias causes poor generalisation and many invalid actions, (2) adding a GN-based relational policy sharply improves learning and transfer, (3) providing the correct sparse relational structure further boosts performance, and (4) combining relational reasoning with explicit physics simulation yields the best overall reward.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  \nInference strategy justification: The paper explicitly traces problems, hypotheses, architectures, experiments, and quantitative results, enabling direct mapping onto the required risk → … → intervention pathway. Only limited light inference (confidence 2) was needed to phrase explicit design choices as actionable interventions.  \nExtraction completeness: All causal-interventional chains from the core risk (“sub-optimal interactive physical reasoning in deep-RL agents”) through the successive reasoning layers to every tested solution (GN relational bias, sparse graphs, physics simulation) are included and inter-connected; no isolated nodes remain.  \nKey limitations: 1) The paper focuses on one benchmark; external generality of interventions is inferred but not empirically shown. 2) Only proof-of-concept maturity is available; operational evidence is absent. 3) The risk node is scoped to physical-reasoning tasks; wider AI-safety ramifications would require additional sources.  \n\nInstruction-set improvement suggestion: Provide an explicit field in the schema for citing numerical performance deltas (e.g., “+183 points”) so downstream analysts can directly quantify effect sizes without re-parsing papers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Suboptimal interactive physical reasoning performance in deep RL agents\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Poor
