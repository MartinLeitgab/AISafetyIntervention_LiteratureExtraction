Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces MORL, an iterative learning framework that alternates between neural-policy optimisation and symbolic program synthesis/repair. By repeatedly (1) extracting a symbolic policy (decision tree), (2) repairing it to satisfy constraints, (3) cloning it back to a neural policy, and (4) fine-tuning with TRPO, the authors show on CartPole that policies reach near-optimal reward far faster than baseline RL while giving users an interpretable, verifiable representation that can be manually or automatically debugged.  
Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
Inference strategy justification: Only explicit statements in the Introduction, Model and Experiments sections were used for causal links; moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied only where the text implies step ordering (e.g. synthesis precedes repair).  
Extraction completeness: All reasoning chains that start with the articulated risks (uninterpretability, lack of safety guarantees, sample inefficiency) and finish with concrete actions (deploy MORL pipeline, program repair, decision-tree extraction, TRPO fine-tuning) are captured. Nodes are named to align with broader AI-safety terminology.  
Key limitations: The source evaluates only CartPole; therefore validation edges have modest confidence. Future prompt versions could request explicit extraction of quantitative results (exact reward numbers) to enrich validation evidence nodes.



Key limitations  
1. Only a simple CartPole task is evaluated; edge confidences remain moderate.  
2. Program repair was manual, so intervention maturity is early-stage.  
3. The framework’s scalability to large models is speculative; future sources may supply stronger validation.  

Possible instruction-set improvements  
• Provide a dedicated field for quantitative metrics inside validation evidence nodes to capture numeric results automatically.  
• Allow chaining multiple validation evidences to the same implementation mechanism without repeating rationale text, reducing redundancy.  
• Supply canonical verb lists inside the schema to avoid synonym divergence across sources (e.g. mitigated_by vs addressed_by).
