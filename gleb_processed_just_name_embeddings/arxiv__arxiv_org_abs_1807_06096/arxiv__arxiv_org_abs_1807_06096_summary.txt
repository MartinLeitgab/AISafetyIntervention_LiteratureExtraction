Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces “probabilistic shields” for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents.  A model-checking procedure calculates, for every state-action pair, the minimum probability of violating a temporal-logic safety property; at run-time a shield blocks actions whose risk exceeds a tunable threshold δ.  Experiments in PAC-MAN and a warehouse robot task show higher performance and far fewer safety violations.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86] – high but not perfect (possible minor naming/edge-type choices).  
Instruction-set improvement: add explicit examples for multi-branch fabrics and clarify whether “validated_by” edges may point into a common evidence node shared by several implementation mechanisms.  
Inference strategy justification: Only modest inference was used—for lifecycle stage categorizations and to generalise experimental results to intervention maturity.  
Extraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning step linking the top-level risk (“safety violations during exploration”) to each concrete, actionable intervention was captured, including scalability concerns and adaptive shield weakening.  All nodes are inter-connected; no satellite nodes remain.  
Key limitations: The data source’s mathematical core was condensed; detailed formulae were not encoded.  Experimental statistics were summarised qualitatively.
