A model-checking procedure calculates, for every state-action pair, the minimum probability of violating a temporal-logic safety property; at run-time a shield blocks actions whose risk exceeds a tunable threshold δ.  Experiments in PAC-MAN and a warehouse robot task show higher performance and far fewer safety violations.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86] – high but not perfect (possible minor naming/edge-type choices).  \nInstruction-set improvement: add explicit examples for multi-branch fabrics and clarify whether “validated_by” edges may point into a common evidence node shared by several implementation mechanisms.  \nInference strategy justification: Only modest inference was used—for lifecycle stage categorizations and to generalise experimental results to intervention maturity.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning step linking the top-level risk (“safety violations during exploration”) to each concrete, actionable intervention was captured, including scalability concerns and adaptive shield weakening.  All nodes are inter-connected; no satellite nodes remain.  \nKey limitations: The data source’s mathematical core was condensed; detailed formulae were not encoded.  Experimental statistics were summarised qualitatively.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Safety violations during exploration in reinforcement learning agents\",\n
