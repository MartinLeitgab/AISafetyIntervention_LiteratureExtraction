          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper “Asymptotic Convergence in Online Learning with Unbounded Delays” analyses why ordinary online-learning regret notions break when feedback may be arbitrarily delayed, and introduces EvOp, an eventually-optimal predictor that compares experts only on sparse, “independent” subsequences of outcomes. It proves EvOp’s convergence to Bayes-optimal performance, shows impossibility results for consistency, and derives very weak convergence-time bounds.  \nExtraction confidence[82] – high confidence that all causal-interventional paths from the text are captured and that JSON is syntactically correct.  \nInstruction-set improvement: include a short reminder that interventions may need light inference when source is purely theoretical; explicitly list “slow-convergence/efficiency” as a recognised risk type so extractors converge on similar node names.  \nInference strategy justification: Two intervention nodes are inferred (algorithm design & accelerated variants) because the paper is theoretical; edges linked with confidence 2 and rationale marks.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: 20 nodes cover each distinctive claim in the core reasoning chains – risks, two separate problem analyses (misleading regret; slow convergence), two theoretical insights, design rationales, detailed implementation mechanisms, three validation evidence nodes, and two actionable interventions. All nodes inter-connect into a single fabric through shared upstream risks.  \nKey limitations: Only theoretical validation evidence; practical performance not empirically demonstrated, so intervention maturity is low. Convergence-speed branch required moderate inference for adaptive variants.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"predictive performance degradation in online learning with unbounded
