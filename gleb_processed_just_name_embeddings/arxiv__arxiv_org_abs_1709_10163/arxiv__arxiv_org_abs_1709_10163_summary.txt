Summary
Data source overview: The paper introduces Deep TAMER, a method that lets an autonomous agent quickly learn policies in pixel-level, high-dimensional tasks by learning a deep neural network model of a non-expert human’s real-time scalar feedback. The authors combine auto-encoder pre-training, importance-weighted SGD and a feedback replay buffer to learn a reward model that drives the agent’s behaviour, and show on Atari Bowling that 15 minutes of human interaction is sufficient for super-human performance.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86] – The fabric captures every explicit causal-interventional link the paper offers (risk → mechanisms → evidence → interventions) and decomposes Deep TAMER into white-box components, with no isolated nodes or direct risk-to-intervention jumps.  The instructions could be improved by explicitly allowing “enabled_by” edges between different implementation mechanisms under the same design rationale, which is common in technical papers like this.

Inference strategy justification: Only minimal inference (confidence 2 edges) was used to cast paper statements into the canonical causal verbs (e.g. recognising that the absence of human feedback causes sparse rewards).

Extraction completeness explanation: All central claims (inefficient RL, sparse rewards, human feedback solution, deep model, pre-training, replay buffer, importance weighting, empirical results) appear as nodes and are linked.  Multiple implementation mechanisms are broken out so other sources describing, for instance, replay buffers, will merge cleanly.

Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence is from a single game; maturity is therefore marked experimental. 2) Edges between implementation mechanisms share a single evidence node; future work could provide finer-grained measurements.
