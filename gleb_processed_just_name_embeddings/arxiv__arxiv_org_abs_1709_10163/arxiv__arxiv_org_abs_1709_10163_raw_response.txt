          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper introduces Deep TAMER, a method that lets an autonomous agent quickly learn policies in pixel-level, high-dimensional tasks by learning a deep neural network model of a non-expert human’s real-time scalar feedback. The authors combine auto-encoder pre-training, importance-weighted SGD and a feedback replay buffer to learn a reward model that drives the agent’s behaviour, and show on Atari Bowling that 15 minutes of human interaction is sufficient for super-human performance.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86] – The fabric captures every explicit causal-interventional link the paper offers (risk → mechanisms → evidence → interventions) and decomposes Deep TAMER into white-box components, with no isolated nodes or direct risk-to-intervention jumps.  The instructions could be improved by explicitly allowing “enabled_by” edges between different implementation mechanisms under the same design rationale, which is common in technical papers like this.\n\nInference strategy justification: Only minimal inference (confidence 2 edges) was used to cast paper statements into the canonical causal verbs (e.g. recognising that the absence of human feedback causes sparse rewards).\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All central claims (inefficient RL, sparse rewards, human feedback solution, deep model, pre-training, replay buffer, importance weighting, empirical results) appear as nodes and are linked.  Multiple implementation mechanisms are broken out so other sources describing, for instance, replay buffers, will merge cleanly.\n\nKey limitations: 1) Validation evidence is from a single game; maturity is therefore marked experimental. 2) Edges between implementation mechanisms share a single evidence node; future work could provide finer-grained measurements.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\":
