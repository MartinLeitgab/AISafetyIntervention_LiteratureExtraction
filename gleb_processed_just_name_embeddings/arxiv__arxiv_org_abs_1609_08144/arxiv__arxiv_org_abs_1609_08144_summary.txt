Summary
Data-source overview: The paper presents Google’s Neural Machine Translation System (GNMT). It identifies several weaknesses of prior NMT systems (slow inference/training, rare-word errors, coverage omissions, optimization/metric mismatch) and introduces a set of architectural, algorithmic and deployment techniques (deep residual LSTMs, wordpiece vocabularies, length/coverage-aware beam search, RL fine-tuning, quantization on TPUs) that together raise translation quality and reduce latency versus phrase-based systems.  
Extraction confidence[83] – high but not perfect because only the dominant causal-interventional chains were captured; hundreds of secondary details were omitted to stay within node/edge-budget.  
Instruction-set improvement: provide an explicit maximum node/edge count per 5 000 words so trade-offs are clearer; include an allowed edge list for “enables”.  
Inference strategy justification: Moderate inference (confidence=2) was used only to connect high-level risks to detailed mechanisms when the text was implicit (e.g. translating coverage omissions into a formal “length bias” problem).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All major solution components that the paper relies on to close the quality/latency gap are represented and connected to the single high-level risk, ensuring a fully connected fabric.  
Key limitations: Hardware parallelism during training and model ensembling paths were left out to keep the graph compact; some BLEU numbers were summarised rather than split into separate evidence nodes.



MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST  
✔ No edge connects risk directly to intervention.  
✔ All pathways share the top risk node; graph fully connected.  
✔ Every node participates in at least one edge; no duplicates.  
✔ The GNMT “framework” is decomposed into residuals, wordpieces, RL, quantisation, decoder.  
✔ JSON structure validated; node names match exactly in edges.
