Summary  
Data source overview: This paper (“Sufficient Conditions for Idealised Models to Have No Adversarial Examples”) analyses why adversarial examples arise in discriminative ML classifiers and proposes a theoretical framework showing that if a model (e.g. a Bayesian neural network – BNN) (1) captures the true invariances of the data distribution and (2) raises its epistemic uncertainty fast enough away from the training manifold, then adversarial examples cannot exist. It supplies mathematical proofs plus empirical studies with Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) BNNs, MC-dropout, dropout ensembles and mutual-information-based detection on synthetic (Manifold-MNIST) and real (cats-vs-dogs) datasets.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
The paper gives explicit causal chains from the risk “adversarial misclassification” to concrete, experimentally evaluated defences (HMC–BNN training, MC-dropout+MI rejection, dropout ensembles, invariant architectures). The JSON captures each reasoning step with unique, merge-ready node names and keeps every node connected. Remaining uncertainty is due to judgement calls on edge types where the text is largely theoretical.

How the instruction set could be improved: 1) provide a short canonical list of edge verbs for “refined_by / extends / improves” relationships, 2) clarify whether multiple design-rationale nodes may feed the same implementation mechanism without extra “refined_by” edges, 3) explicitly allow evidence nodes that demonstrate failure cases (needed here for the “dropout holes” finding).

Inference strategy justification: Where the paper did not phrase a step as an “intervention”, moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to formulate clearly actionable interventions (e.g. “design invariant architectures”). All such inferences are marked with confidence 2 edges and explanatory rationales.

Extraction completeness explanation: The fabric includes 16 concept nodes (risk→validation evidence) and four intervention nodes. All causal–interventional pathways mentioned in the text are covered and inter-connected, no orphan nodes remain.

Key limitations: The paper’s theoretical result is idealised; real-world scalability of HMC is limited. Validation of invariant architectures is weaker than for HMC/dropout and is marked accordingly.
