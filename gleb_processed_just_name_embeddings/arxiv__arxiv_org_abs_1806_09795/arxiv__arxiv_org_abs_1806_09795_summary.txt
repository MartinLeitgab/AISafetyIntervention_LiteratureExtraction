Summary  
Data source overview: The paper develops five new multi-agent inverse reinforcement-learning (MIRL) formulations (uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, uNE-MIRL).  For each, it derives linear constraints that make the observed bi-policy a unique equilibrium, proposes Bayesian/LP estimation procedures, and validates them on Grid-World and abstract football simulations.  The work tackles the core risk that reward models inferred from demonstrations become unsafe when strategic interaction between agents is ignored.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84] – The extracted nodes map every reasoning step from the two high-level risks (reward mis-alignment & equilibrium ambiguity) through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation techniques, empirical evidence and finally to concrete AI-safety interventions.  All nodes are inter-connected, names follow canonical patterns, and JSON passes syntactic checks.  Improvements: provide an official list of allowed edge verbs (currently inferred) and explicit examples for multi-branch fabrics.

Inference strategy justification: Only moderate inference was used to cast MIRL methodological contributions into AI-safety-relevant interventions (confidence 2 for those edges).  All other links are explicitly supported in Sections 1-8.

Extraction completeness explanation: 16 nodes (≈ one per 350 words) cover every major claim, method, finding and intervention appearing in the paper; all share at least one edge, forming one connected fabric.

Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence comes from small grids; real-world scalability not covered. 2) Interventions are research-stage (maturity-2). 3) Robustness under partial observability only preliminary.
