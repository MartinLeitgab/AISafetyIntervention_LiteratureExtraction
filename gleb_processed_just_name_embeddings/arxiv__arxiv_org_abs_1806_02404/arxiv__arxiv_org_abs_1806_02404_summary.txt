Summary  
Data source overview: The paper re-examines the Fermi paradox by replacing point-estimate Drake-equation calculations with probability-distribution modelling and Bayesian conditioning on non-detection. Monte-Carlo simulations and parameter-uncertainty analysis show that it is unsurprising, and even likely, that humanity is alone in the Milky Way or observable universe, thereby dissolving the apparent paradox and removing pessimistic conclusions about civilisational self-destruction.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[89]  
This confidence reflects strong alignment with the mandated extraction structure, though uncertainty remains over optimal intervention-lifecycle coding for purely scientific-methodology actions.

Instruction-set improvement: Clarify how to handle methodological papers whose “interventions” are research practices rather than AI-system controls, and provide examples of lifecycle/maturity mapping for such cases.

Inference strategy justification: Interventions were not directly labelled; moderate inference converted the methodological recommendations into actionable research interventions (edge confidence 2 where inference applied). All other edges follow explicit causal reasoning in the text.

Extraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning step relating misuse of point estimates to the risk of Fermi-paradox misinterpretation, the theoretical recognition of deep uncertainties, the design of uncertainty-aware modelling, implementation techniques, validation simulations, and the ensuing methodological interventions is captured. Branches for literature-resampling, author-defined distributions, and Bayesian updating are all included and connected.

Key limitations:  
1. The fabric is limited to methodological interventions, with no hardware or policy actions.  
2. Parameter-correlation issues discussed briefly in the paper are not modelled as separate nodes to avoid unnecessary fragmentation.  
3. Confidence scores rely on qualitative assessment since statistical significance values are not always provided.
