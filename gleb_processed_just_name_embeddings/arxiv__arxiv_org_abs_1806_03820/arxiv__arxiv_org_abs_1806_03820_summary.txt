Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces an optimality-preserving modified Bellman update that exploits the information structure of Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL).  By pruning all but the human’s optimal action at each step, the action space shrinks exponentially, enabling exact and approximate POMDP solvers to scale to previously intractable CIRL problems and to relax the unrealistic assumption of perfect human rationality.  Experiments show large speed-ups, better task success than IRL, and robustness when humans act sub-optimally or pedagogically.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  
Inference strategy justification:  All causal-interventional chains explicitly argued in the text were mapped; moderate inference (edge confidence = 2) was used only to connect high-level AI-safety risks to the technical contributions, as the paper presupposes the risk context.  
Extraction completeness explanation:  Every distinct risk, problem analysis, theoretical insight, design rationale, implementation mechanism, validation evidence and intervention mentioned in the core argument was decomposed into nodes (21 total) and interconnected so that every node participates in at least one pathway, forming a single fabric.  
Key limitations:  The source is algorithm-centric; real-world deployment constraints (e.g., dataset bias) are not covered, so intervention maturity remains prototype level.  Future prompt versions could request explicit mapping of statistical metrics (e.g., speed-up factors) as quantitative node attributes.



Improvements to instruction set:  
1. Clarify whether the edge sequence risk→caused_by→problem analysis→caused_by→theoretical insight is mandatory, as wording can imply opposite causal direction.  
2. Provide explicit examples of multiple pathways sharing nodes.  
3. Permit optional quantitative attributes (speed-up factors) for validation nodes to capture empirical strength.  

These tweaks would reduce ambiguity and enrich downstream analysis.
