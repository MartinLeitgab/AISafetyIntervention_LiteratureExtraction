Summary
Data source overview: The paper introduces RUDDER, a reinforcement-learning approach that counteracts the well-known bias and variance problems that occur when rewards are strongly delayed.  It does so by (1) mathematically redefining the task as a return-equivalent decision process whose expected future reward is zero, (2) achieving this by “reward redistribution”, and (3) learning the redistribution through “return decomposition” with an LSTM that attributes final returns back to the decisive early actions.  Large empirical speed-ups are shown on artificial delayed-reward benchmarks and on delayed-reward Atari games.

Inference strategy justification:  The paper’s formal sections and proofs supply explicit causal steps from the risk of inefficient credit assignment to the RUDDER intervention.  Where explicit wording is absent (e.g., AI-safety framing), only light inference (confidence=2) was used to phrase nodes in a way that will merge across many sources.

Extraction completeness explanation:  All reasoning steps that link the top-level risk to the concrete RUDDER training procedure are represented, including: delayed-reward risk → TD/MC bias/variance analysis → theoretical goal of zero expected future reward → design of reward redistribution & return decomposition → concrete LSTM implementation → empirical validation → actionable interventions.  Each node is referenced by the closest preceding section title.

Key limitations:  The fabric is restricted to episodic, finite-horizon MDPs; paper acknowledges that very long sequences or tasks without delayed reward may make RUDDER less effective.  Broader AI-safety risks such as deceptive alignment are outside the paper’s scope.
