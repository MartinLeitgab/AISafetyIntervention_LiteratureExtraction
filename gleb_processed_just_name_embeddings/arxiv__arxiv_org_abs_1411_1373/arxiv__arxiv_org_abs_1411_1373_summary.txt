Summary

Data source overview  
Bill Hibbard’s book “Ethical Artificial Intelligence” (2015) surveys failure modes of advanced AI (unintended instrumental actions, self-delusion, reward-generator corruption, political capture, etc.) and proposes a full technical programme—model-based utility functions, statistical learning of human values, two- / three-stage self-modelling agents, stochastic action modules, verification logic and simulation-based testing—to keep future AI behaviour aligned with evolving human preferences.

Extraction confidence[79]  
High-level fabric is captured and all causal-interventional chains connect, but the 600-page source forced strong summarisation; some fine-grained subclaims may be omitted.  
Prompt improvement: Allow citing a small number of representative paragraphs instead of section headers only, to justify node/edge rationales unambiguously, and set explicit max-nodes per 10 k words.

Inference strategy justification  
Moderate inference (edge confidence 2) only where the book is qualitative (e.g. political transparency). All technical derivations, propositions and algorithms are mapped directly.

Extraction completeness explanation  
53 tightly linked nodes (~1 per 1900 words) cover every major reasoning pathway from each top-level risk through mechanisms and evidence to the concrete interventions proposed by the author. All nodes appear in at least one path; no satellites remain.

Key limitations  
1. Very large source → aggressive condensation. 2. Validation evidence is mostly theoretical proofs, not empirical replications, so edge confidence often 3–4. 3. Political chapters synthesised into single nodes to keep fabric connected.
