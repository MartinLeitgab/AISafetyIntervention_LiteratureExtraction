Summary  
Data-source overview: The paper introduces an “explainer” network that can be attached to any pre-trained convolutional neural network (the “performer”) and, without additional supervision, disentangles each middle-layer channel so that it represents a single object part while preserving the performer’s classification accuracy. An encoder–decoder auto-encoder architecture, dual-track encoder (interpretable vs. ordinary), a template-based filter loss and a reconstruction loss are combined to achieve high interpretability (35-70 % reduction in location-instability) with negligible accuracy loss (<1 %).  

Extraction confidence[87]  
Inference strategy justification: Only minor, guideline-allowed inference was needed to turn empirical findings into actionable AI-safety interventions (e.g. “attach explainer at deployment”).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional chains from the two central risks (opacity & accuracy-loss trade-off) through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationale, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence to two concrete interventions are captured, inter-connected and free of isolated nodes.  
Key limitations: 1) Paper is computer-vision-specific; transfer to other modalities is inferred not proven. 2) Validation evidence is limited to two datasets; maturity was therefore set to Experimental (2).  

How to improve prompt: add explicit examples of mapping quantitative evaluation metrics (e.g. “location instability”) to “validation evidence” nodes to reduce ambiguity; clarify whether multiple interventions branching from the same evidence need separate edge objects or can share one “motivates” edge list.
