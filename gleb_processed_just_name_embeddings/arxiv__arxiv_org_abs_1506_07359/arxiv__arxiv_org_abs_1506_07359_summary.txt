Summary
Data source overview:  
The paper “Sequential Extensions of Causal and Evidential Decision Theory” formalises how embedded (physicalistic) AI agents should make sequential decisions.  It introduces three extended decision-theoretic frameworks—Sequential Action-Evidential DT (SAEDT), Sequential Policy-Evidential DT (SPEDT) and Sequential Causal DT (SCDT)—and analyses their behaviour on Newcomb-like and toxoplasmosis-like scenarios.  Results show that classical CDT or EDT alone can lead to systematically sub-optimal (or unsafe) decisions when an agent’s actions are correlated with hidden environmental states or predictor models.  The authors argue for more adequate, “physicalistic” decision frameworks and show how commitment devices or information avoidance can improve outcomes.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
Inference strategy justification:  The paper is purely theoretical; interventions are not packaged as engineering recommendations.  I therefore inferred three practically relevant interventions (adopt SPEDT-style reasoning, incorporate commitment devices, and avoid information that provokes sub-optimal evidential responses) directly supported by the authors’ toy-problem findings.  All inferences are flagged with confidence 2.  
Extraction completeness:  15 interconnected nodes capture every reasoning step from risk → problem → theory → design → mechanism → evidence → intervention, with no isolated nodes.  
Key limitations:  1) Validation evidence is limited to toy examples, so edge confidence is ≤3.  2) Further empirical work is needed to operationalise the interventions in large-scale AI training.



Limitations & prompt-improvement suggestions (not part of JSON):
1. Prompt could explicitly ask whether interventions must be drawn only from empirical engineering papers; here theoretical work required light inference—clarify acceptable inference depth.  
2. Adding a “research agenda intervention” category might help accommodate open-problem outputs like “develop new physicalistic decision theory”.
