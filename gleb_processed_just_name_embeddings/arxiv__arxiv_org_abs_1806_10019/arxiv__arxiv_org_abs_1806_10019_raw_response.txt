          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper proposes “adversarial exploration” for self-supervised imitation learning (IL). A PPO-based RL agent is rewarded by the prediction error of an inverse-dynamics model, collecting “hard” training samples; a reward-shaping threshold δ stabilises training. Experiments on five MuJoCo robotic tasks show higher success rates, better data-efficiency and robustness to action noise compared with Random, Curiosity and other baselines.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  \nInference strategy justification: All causal chains explicitly stated in Introduction (§1), Methodology (§3) and Experiments (§4) were mapped. Only modest inference (confidence 2) was needed to phrase the two high-level risks and human-cost problem.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning step the authors use to justify their method—inefficient exploration → adversarial curriculum → stabilisation → PPO implementation → empirical gains—appears as connected nodes, ending in two actionable interventions.  \nKey limitations: 1) Paper is robotics-specific; extrapolation to general AI safety may require new nodes. 2) Validation evidence is from single-team experiments, so generality unclear. 3) Some edges (risk ↔︎ problem analysis) are based on stated motivation rather than direct data.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Suboptimal inverse dynamics models in
