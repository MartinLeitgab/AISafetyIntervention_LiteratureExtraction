Summary
Data source overview: The paper “Simplifying Reward Design through Divide-and-Conquer” proposes “independent reward design”, where a robot engineer specifies a separate proxy reward for each training environment. Treating every proxy as conditionally-independent evidence of the underlying “true” reward, the robot uses an Inverse-Reward-Design (IRD) observation model plus Bayesian inference (Monte-Carlo / Metropolis sampling) to obtain a posterior over true rewards, then plans with the posterior mean (or risk-averse variants). Two user studies (grid-world, 7-DOF arm) and three sensitivity analyses show the approach is faster, easier and yields lower regret than traditional joint reward design.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [86]

Inference strategy justification: All nodes come directly from explicit paper claims except the “environment subset selection” & “risk-averse planning” interventions, which the authors highlight as future work or alternative uses of the posterior; they are marked lower maturity with appropriately low edge-confidence.

Extraction completeness explanation: Each causal-interventional pathway from the central risk of reward misspecification to every actionable intervention described or implied is captured, with shared nodes inter-linking paths into a single connected fabric. Nodes are granular enough to merge across other sources (e.g., “Bayesian posterior inference over true reward using IRD observation model and Monte Carlo sampling”).

Key limitations: 1) The paper does not yet empirically validate risk-averse planning, so that branch of the fabric relies on light inference. 2) Some numerical implementation details (β selection, sampler settings) are omitted because they do not affect causal structure. 3) Future work on large environment sets is speculative.

Improving the instruction set: Allow an explicit “future work” concept category to distinguish between validated mechanisms and forward-looking ideas; this would avoid labeling speculative content as interventions or design rationales. Also, clarifying whether multiple validation evidence nodes may point to the same intervention (current template implicitly allows it) would remove ambiguity.



Key mandatory verification checklist satisfied:
✓ No risk–intervention direct edges  
✓ All nodes participate in ≥1 edge; no isolated nodes  
✓ Shared nodes interconnect all paths forming a single fabric  
✓ “Independent reward design” framework decomposed into white-box component nodes  
✓ JSON structure validated; node names match edge references exactly.
