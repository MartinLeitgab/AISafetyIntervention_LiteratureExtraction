          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper “Simplifying Reward Design through Divide-and-Conquer” proposes “independent reward design”, where a robot engineer specifies a separate proxy reward for each training environment. Treating every proxy as conditionally-independent evidence of the underlying “true” reward, the robot uses an Inverse-Reward-Design (IRD) observation model plus Bayesian inference (Monte-Carlo / Metropolis sampling) to obtain a posterior over true rewards, then plans with the posterior mean (or risk-averse variants). Two user studies (grid-world, 7-DOF arm) and three sensitivity analyses show the approach is faster, easier and yields lower regret than traditional joint reward design.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [86]\n\nInference strategy justification: All nodes come directly from explicit paper claims except the “environment subset selection” & “risk-averse planning” interventions, which the authors highlight as future work or alternative uses of the posterior; they are marked lower maturity with appropriately low edge-confidence.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: Each causal-interventional pathway from the central risk of reward misspecification to every actionable intervention described or implied is captured, with shared nodes inter-linking paths into a single connected fabric. Nodes are granular enough to merge across other sources (e.g., “Bayesian posterior inference over true reward using IRD observation model and Monte Carlo sampling”).\n\nKey limitations: 1) The paper does not yet empirically validate risk-averse planning, so that branch of the fabric relies on light inference. 2) Some numerical implementation details (β selection, sampler settings) are omitted because they do not affect causal structure. 3) Future work on large environment sets is speculative.\n\nImproving the instruction set: Allow an explicit “future work” concept category to distinguish between validated mechanisms and forward-looking ideas; this would avoid labeling speculative content as interventions or design rationales. Also, clarifying whether multiple validation evidence nodes may point to the same intervention (current template implicitly allows it) would remove ambiguity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reward misspecification in robot planning across environments\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"reward design errors in robotics\", \"proxy reward mismatch\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Robots optimising poorly-specified reward functions can behave undesirably or unsafely when deployed in novel environments.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced in I Introduction as the core failure mode motivating the work.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Designer overburden when specifying joint reward across diverse environments\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"reward tuning burden\", \"joint reward design difficulty\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Specifying a single reward that yields correct behaviour in all training environments requires many frustrating tuning iterations.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Detailed in I Introduction describing iterative tuning pain-points.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Proxy reward non-generalization to novel environments\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"reward generalization failure\", \"training-test reward mismatch\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"A reward that induces optimal behaviour in training environments can fail when test environments contain unseen conditions.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Explained in II Related Work under Inverse Reward Design examples (e.g., wet road case).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Simpler per-environment reward specification reduces cognitive load\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"independent reward ease\", \"single-environment reward simplicity\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Designers find it easier to express correct trade-offs when focusing on one environment at a time.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Posited in I Introduction with household motion-planning example.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Independently specified proxy rewards provide conditional evidence of true reward\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"proxies as observations\", \"conditional independence of proxies\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Each per-environment proxy reward is treated as an observation conditionally independent given the true reward parameters.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Formalised in III Independent Reward Design, Eq.
