It proves formal error bounds, builds practical neural implementations, and shows large empirical gains in a text-adventure game and a real-world dialogue system.\n\nInference strategy justification: Wherever the paper gave quantitative or qualitative evidence (e.g. empirical benchmarks, mathematical bounds) edges were assigned confidence 4; where an explicit causal claim was only argued conceptually, confidence 3 was used. Two moderate inferences (marked confidence 2) were needed to derive an “adaptive abstraction-refinement” intervention suggested by the analysis but not yet experimentally validated.\n\nExtraction completeness: 15 tightly-scoped nodes capture every reasoning step from the top-level risk (policy failure from data-inefficiency) through problems, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence and finally to actionable interventions.  All nodes join into one connected fabric; no dangling nodes or direct risk-to-intervention links remain. Framework components (state-to-abstract mapping, neural transition model, rollout training) are fully decomposed.\n\nKey limitations: 1) Only two downstream interventions were inferable; additional deployment-phase mitigations are beyond the paper’s scope. 2) Empirical evidence limited to two tasks, making edge confidence <5. 3) The mathematical bound node is summarised rather than fully formalised.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]\n\nThis instruction set could be improved by clarifying how many validation evidence nodes should be produced when a paper gives several quantitative results of the same kind, and by giving an explicit mapping between edge verbs and typical rhetorical relations (e.g. “addresses” vs “mitigates”).\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n
