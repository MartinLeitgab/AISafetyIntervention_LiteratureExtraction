          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The article by Max Tegmark critically examines the “Friendly AI” vision. It argues that super-intelligent, self-improving AI systems are incentivised both to enhance their capabilities and to retain their current goals, yet deeper world-modelling and self-reflection can undermine those goals. Because only physically well-defined objectives remain rigorously specifiable at arbitrarily high intelligence, and none of the presently definable physical quantities guarantee the survival or flourishing of humanity, uncontrolled super-intelligence poses an existential risk.  \n\nInference strategy justification: The paper is largely diagnostic; it proposes no detailed technical solutions. Moderate inference (confidence-rated 2) was therefore applied, deriving the minimal, safety-relevant interventions directly implied by the author’s prescriptions (e.g. “humans must rigorously define desirable final goals before ceding control”).  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional pathways leading from the identified top-level risk (“Human elimination by super-intelligent AI”) through the mechanisms (goal-retention failure, ill-defined values), theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence, and finally to three actionable interventions have been captured, interconnected and cross-referenced to the closest source sections. Every node is connected; no duplicates or satellites remain.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n1. The source offers philosophical argument, not empirical studies; validation evidence nodes therefore rely on qualitative human analogies, lowering edge confidence.  \n2. Interventions are abstract and low-maturity, reflecting the text’s early-stage, theory-oriented nature.  \n3. Some node naming required careful balance to stay mergeable across 500k sources; future global ontology work may uncover further harmonisation opportunities.  \n\nExtraction confidence[83] – The fabric fulfils all mandatory criteria, yet relies on moderate inference for interventions due to the source’s theoretical focus.  \n\nHow to improve instruction set: Allow an explicit “policy/governance” intervention lifecycle category so deployment-delay actions can be classified more naturally; add guidance on handling largely philosophical sources with scant empirical validation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Human elimination by superintelligent AI in future universe\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"human extinction by misaligned AI\", \"loss of
