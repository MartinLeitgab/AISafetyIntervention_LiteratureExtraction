          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper “I Don’t Want to Think About It Now: Decision Theory With Costly Computation” proposes a formal decision-theoretic framework where agents choose Turing-machine policies and receive utility that explicitly subtracts the cost (complexity) of computation.  Using this framework the authors (i) explain cognitive biases (first-impression, belief-polarisation, status-quo), (ii) formalise “value of computational information” and “value of conversation”, and (iii) link zero-knowledge proofs to bounded value of conversation.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[88] – High confidence that all causal-interventional pathways in the paper have been represented, every node is connected, naming follows the required patterns, and JSON is syntactically valid.  Moderate uncertainty remains because the paper is mostly theoretical so interventions had to be (lightly) inferred.\n\nInstruction-set improvement:  The instructions could clarify how to rank-order multiple equally plausible intervention inferences and whether to suppress paths that remain purely explanatory with no intervention.  A short schema example for multi-branch fabrics would reduce ambiguity.\n\nInference-strategy justification:  Because the paper is principally a theoretical proposal, no direct interventions are prescribed.  I therefore used “moderate inference” (edge confidence = 2 where applicable) to derive practical AI-safety interventions that naturally follow from the authors’ design rationales.\n\nExtraction completeness:  All risks (unmodelled computation cost → biased or unsafe decisions), explanatory mechanisms, theoretical constructs, validation examples, and the three most safety-relevant interventions are represented.  Nodes were kept at a granularity that will merge cleanly across many sources (e.g., “complexity function integrated into reward calculation” rather than just “complexity”).\n\nKey limitations:  • The framework is not empirically validated on large-scale AI systems; therefore intervention maturity is necessarily low.  • Some edges rely on illustrative examples, not controlled studies, so evidence confidence is medium.  • Only three interventions were inferred to avoid speculative overreach.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Suboptimal decision outcomes in AI systems due
