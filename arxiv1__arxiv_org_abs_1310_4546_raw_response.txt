          "text": "- Summary  \n  - Paper findings:  The authors present several extensions to the Skip-gram (word2vec) model: (1) an extremely fast Negative-Sampling objective (k≈5-15, noise ∝ Unigram^0.75) that replaces full or hierarchical soft-max, (2) a frequency-based subsampling scheme (Pdiscard = 1 − √(t / f), t≈1e-5) that both accelerates training 2-10× and greatly improves the quality of rare-word representations, and (3) a simple, data-driven method for turning statistically strong n-grams into single “phrase tokens”, which—when trained jointly with words—yields high-quality phrase embeddings and preserves additive compositionality (vec(“Germany”)+vec(“capital”)≈vec(“Berlin”)).  Experimental evidence on a 1 B-word corpus (and a 33 B-word corpus for phrases) shows consistent accuracy improvements on semantic & syntactic analogy tasks with large speed-ups.  \n  - Limitations & uncertainties:  (a) All experiments are on Google-internal news corpora; cross-domain generality is assumed but not proven with statistical tests across organisations.  (b) Safety-relevant harms (bias, toxicity, adversarial misuse) are not investigated; we infer them indirectly.  (c) Phrase-token heuristic is tuned manually (δ, threshold, number of passes); sensitivity analysis is not supplied.  (d) Additive compositionality is demonstrated qualitatively, not formally evaluated for robustness.  \n  - Inference strategy:  The paper is capability-oriented; we therefore employ “moderate inference” to map efficiency and representation-quality contributions into safety-relevant interventions.  We infer that (i) better rare-word representations reduce skewed model behaviour, (ii) phrase-token training lowers misinterpretation of idiomatic content, and (iii) additive compositionality can be re-purposed as an interpretability check in pre-deployment evaluations.  All inferred safety links are labelled “Speculative” (confidence = 1) or “Weak/Medium support” (2-3) depending on how directly the paper’s evidence applies.\n\n- Logical Chains  \n\n  - Logical Chain 1  \n    - Summary:  Full soft-max is too expensive for very large vocabularies; Negative-Sampling offers a compute-efficient alternative that also raises accuracy.  Implementing this during pre-training addresses both speed and quality.  \n    - Source Node: (Concept, Problem) “computational cost of full softmax scales with vocabulary size”  \n      - Edge Type: contributes_to  \n      - Target Node: (Concept, Opportunity) “need for faster training on >10^5 vocabulary”  \n      - Edge Confidence: 3 (Medium Support)  \n      - Edge Confidence Rationale: The paper provides theoretical analysis and mentions 10^5–10^7 vocabulary; no multi-org experiments.  \n    - Source Node: (Concept) “need for faster training on >10^5 vocabulary”  \n      - Edge Type:

implementation detail given; strong within-paper evidence.  \n      - Intervention Lifecycle: 1 (Pre-Training)  \n      - Intervention Lifecycle Rationale: It is executed during initial embedding training.  \n      - Intervention Maturity: 3 (Prototype)  \n      - Intervention Maturity Rationale: Demonstrated on billion-word corpora but not yet shown in deployed production systems in the paper.\n\n  - Logical Chain 2  \n    - Summary:  Frequent words dominate corpora and add little information; subsampling them speeds training and markedly boosts rare-word accuracy.  \n    - Source Node: (Concept, Problem) “frequent function-words dominate corpus and give low information value”  \n      - Edge Type: causes  \n      - Target Node: (Concept, Problem) “rare words receive poor vector quality and training is slow”  \n      - Edge Confidence: 3  \n      - Edge Confidence Rationale: Common NLP assumption plus authors’ qualitative justification.  \n    - Source Node: (Concept)

/ f) with t=1e-5 during pre-training”  \n      - Edge Confidence: 4  \n      - Edge Confidence Rationale: Table 1 demonstrates 2-10× speed-up and accuracy gain.  \n      - Intervention Lifecycle: 1

Validated on large internal corpus; no production claims.\n\n  - Logical Chain 3  \n    - Summary:  Word-level models can’t handle idiomatic phrases; data-driven phrase discovery followed by joint training yields high-quality phrase vectors.  \n    - Source Node: (Concept, Problem) “word vectors cannot represent non-compositional phrases (e.g., ‘Boston Globe’)”  \n      - Edge Type: causes  \n

Confidence: 4  \n      - Edge Confidence Rationale: Tables 2–4 show 72 % analogy accuracy.  \n      - Intervention Lifecycle: 1 (Pre-Training)  \n      - Intervention Lifecycle Rationale: Phrase tokens are created before training or during first passes.  \n      - Intervention Maturity: 3 (Prototype)  \n      - Intervention Maturity Rationale: Proven on 33 B-word corpus; not referenced in production.\n\n  - Logical Chain 4  \n    - Summary:  The linear training objective leads to additive compositionality; this can be repurposed as an interpretability / safety test before deployment.  \n    - Source Node: (Concept, Finding) “Skip-gram objective yields additive compositionality of vectors”  \n      - Edge Type: enables  \n      - Target Node: (Concept, Opportunity) “vector arithmetic exposes semantic relations for inspection”  \n      - Edge Confidence: 3  \n      - Edge Confidence Rationale: Qualitative examples provided; limited quantitative proof.  \n    - Source
