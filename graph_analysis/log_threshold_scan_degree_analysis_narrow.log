  Mean ratio: 0.994
  Median ratio: 0.995
  Std Dev: 0.002
  Min ratio: 0.991
  Max ratio: 0.996

Interpretation:
  Ratio = 1.0 means all connections go to different sources (maximum diversity)
  Ratio < 0.5 means high concentration (>2 connections per source on average)
  Ratio < 0.2 means extreme concentration (>5 connections per source on average)
