  Nodes checked: 250
  Nodes with >100 edges and concentration: 8 (3.2%)

Among nodes with concentration:
  Mean ratio: 0.988
  Median ratio: 0.994
  Std Dev: 0.013
  Min ratio: 0.956
  Max ratio: 0.999

Interpretation:
  Ratio = 1.0 means all connections go to different sources (maximum diversity)
  Ratio < 0.5 means high concentration (>2 connections per source on average)
  Ratio < 0.2 means extreme concentration (>5 connections per source on average)
