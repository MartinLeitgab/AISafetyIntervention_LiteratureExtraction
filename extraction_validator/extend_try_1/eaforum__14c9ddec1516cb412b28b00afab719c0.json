    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has CRITICAL SCHEMA ISSUES (missing required fields, orphaned attributes) and MAJOR CONTENT ISSUES (30% of validation evidence nodes represent specific empirical results not mentioned in the DATA_SOURCE, heavy inference for intervention specifics without explicit course guidance). The extraction successfully captures the course curriculum structure and main safety topics, but violates the core instruction to extract only content supported by the DATA_SOURCE with marked inference. The graph requires significant remediation: (1) remove non-existent validation evidence nodes (6 nodes), (2) add missing schema fields to all nodes and edges, (3) remove embedding fields, (4) mark all inferred intervention details as confidence 1-2, (5) add missing curriculum topics (Hazard Analysis, data poisoning, value lock-in, persuasive AI), and (6) reduce intervention maturity ratings from 3 to 2 after validation evidence removal. After these fixes, the extraction would become valid and mergeable, though it represents a moderate-confidence fabric (60-70% confidence) built significantly on inference rather than direct DATA_SOURCE evidence."
