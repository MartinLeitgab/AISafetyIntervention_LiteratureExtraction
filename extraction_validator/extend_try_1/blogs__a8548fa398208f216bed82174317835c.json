    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates solid structural coverage of the RETRO paper's main causal pathways from problems (hallucinations, energy consumption, interpretability) through theoretical insights, design rationales, and implementation mechanisms to validation evidence and interventions. However, the JSON has critical schema compliance issues: all nodes lack required 'node_rationale' field, all edges lack required 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields, and intervention nodes lack lifecycle/maturity rationale fields. Additionally, the first causal edge is directionally reversed (hallucinations caused BY context limitations, not the other way around). Three significant content gaps exist: missing validation evidence nodes for performance scaling curve and qualitative output improvements, incomplete coverage of the direct safety intervention pathway through database curation, and a duplicate node pair that should be merged. After applying the 25+ proposed fixes (adding 3 nodes, merging 1 node pair, correcting edge direction, populating all missing rationale fields with evidence-based reasoning, and adding 7 new edges), the graph becomes schema-compliant, fully connected, and comprehensively captures the knowledge fabric linking risks to interventions across all reasoning pathways."

      "BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: Missing 'node_rationale' field on all 16 nodes violates schema requirement 'node_rationale: why essential to fabric with closest preceding data source section title reference' - this is mandatory per schema and instructions Step 2",
      "BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: Missing 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' on all 17 edges violates schema requirement - these are mandatory per Step 3 final output format specification",
      "BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: Intervention nodes (15,16) missing 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' - mandatory per schema when intervention_lifecycle and intervention_maturity are populated",
      "MAJOR ISSUE: Edge causality error - first edge reverses causality. Source claims 'hallucinations occur because limited context forces models to rely on imperfect parametric knowledge' but graph shows hallucinations→context limitation. DATA_SOURCE evidence: Figure 3 baseline vs RETRO directly shows hallucinations decrease WITH retrieval, implying they were caused by lack of retrieval access",
      "MAJOR ISSUE: Three validation evidence nodes missing despite explicit mention in DATA_SOURCE: (1) continuous scaling curve 'improves continuously as we increase the size of the retrieval database, at least up to 2 trillion tokens' with Figure 2 reference, (2) factual accuracy improvement separate from general quality, (3) topic coherence improvement both shown in Figures 3-4",
      "MAJOR ISSUE: Safety intervention pathway incomplete - paper explicitly states 'provides a route for direct interventions through the retrieval database to improve the safety of text continuation' but graph shows no explicit connection between this claim and the database curation intervention. New edges needed linking retrieval mechanism to safety intervention",
      "DUPLICATE NODE: 'Low interpretability of transformer predictions' and 'Opaque latent reasoning without provenance in dense transformers' represent same problem concept. Per instructions: 'avoid duplicate nodes' and 'merge if describing same concept'. Should consolidate to single 'Low interpretability and opaque latent reasoning in dense transformers' node",
      "EDGE COVERAGE GAP: No edge connects performance scaling validation evidence to the RETRO design intervention, missing key motivation pathway. DATA_SOURCE: Figure 2 and scaling discussion motivates adoption",
      "EDGE COVERAGE GAP: Factual accuracy improvements and topic coherence improvements only partially motivate main intervention. Need explicit edges from these validation evidence nodes to RETRO intervention node",
      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: 'embedding' field appears in extracted graph but is not in required schema - should be removed from all nodes and edges",
      "VALIDATION STRATEGY: Cross-referenced all node claims against specific DATA_SOURCE quotes - all claims are supported by text but evidence quality varies from 4 (strong empirical: benchmark comparisons) to 2 (weak inference: safety curation without explicit demonstration)",
      "EXTRACTION COMPLETENESS: All six concept node categories (risk, problem analysis, theoretical insight, design rationale, implementation mechanism, validation evidence) are represented. Both intervention nodes align with lifecycle/maturity expectations. Knowledge fabric forms connected DAG from risks through concepts to interventions with no orphaned nodes if fixes applied",
      "MERGEABILITY ASSESSMENT: Node naming follows granularity rules well (e.g., 'Cross-attention fusion of retrieved neighbors...' not just 'fusion' and includes context). After de-duplication and enhanced naming, nodes should merge cleanly across similar data sources in larger corpus"
