Additionally, approximately 10 concept nodes important to complete knowledge fabric are missing (reward model robustness, sandbagging, backtesting proxy, inconsistency detection, asymmetry in failure detectability, procedure-level robustness, practical recursive heuristics, strategy enumeration assumption, and others). Key edge corrections needed: expertise evaluation's relationship to capability elicitation is mislabeled as 'mitigated_by' when it should be 'required_by' or 'preceded_by', and confidence should be 1-2 not 2. The graph would be valid after fixes but is currently non-compliant with mandatory schema requirements and incompletely covers knowledge fabric."

Node 21 is named 'Iteratively improve oversight procedures based on red-team findings to enhance local adequacy' - but edge typo breaks reference.",
      "COVERAGE MAJOR GAPS: Source Appendix sections define 4 explicit proxy failure construction strategies (expensive validation, environment modification, sandwiching, historical backtesting) but only first 3 are captured as nodes. Backtesting example is completely missing. Inconsistency strategy mentioned in source but not extracted. Source explicitly discusses asymmetry between detecting egregious vs subtle failures but this distinction not in graph. Reward model vs procedure-level robustness distinction emphasized in source but not adequately represented.",
      "CONCEPT CATEGORIZATION ERRORS: 'Capability elicitation solvable before models sabotage evaluation' categorized as theoretical insight but source presents as uncertain assumption: 'I think that models will be dangerous and useful' - tentative language indicates this is problem analysis (an unresolved challenge), not established insight. Edge 'mitigated_by' from inadequacy to this node is semantically incorrect - capability elicitation is prerequisite for testing, not solution to inadequacy.",

Source provides concrete measurement approach (percentile-based reward thresholds) not reflected in validation evidence node.",
      "RECURSIVE EVALUATION UNDERREPRESENTATION: Source discusses formalization difficulties in recursive setups at length ('every formal procedure we've come up with has had some counterexample') and proposes pragmatic heuristic fallback, but graph doesn't capture this pragmatic intervention node or the challenge/fallback relationship. Source: 'Appendix: more on evaluating recursive setups' describes incomplete formalization requiring judgment-based approach.",
