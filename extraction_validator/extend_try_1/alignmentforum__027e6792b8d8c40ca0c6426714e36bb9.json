    "summary": "The extraction captures the core conceptual framework and main causal pathways from the source material but contains critical schema violations and logical direction errors that prevent valid JSON output. Missing required fields (node_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale) across all nodes and edges are blockers. Logical errors include reversed edge directions (misconception causing problem, environment diversity being implemented by specific mechanism rather than vice versa) and incomplete separation of the two distinct failure modes explicitly enumerated in the source ('Selecting For Bad Behaviour' vs 'Induced Goal-Directedness'). The extraction misses several validation evidence nodes (selective breeding analogy, conditional deception framework) and fails to capture the complete knowledge fabric showing how the two failure cases branch differently. With the proposed fixes applied, the extraction would become valid and mergeable."
