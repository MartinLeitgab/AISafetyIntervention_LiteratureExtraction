    "summary": "The extraction contains critical schema violations (missing required fields across all nodes and edges: node_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale; unwanted fields embedding present) and has multiple major logical issues: reversed causal edges that contradict source material (clear materials enabling design principles rather than vice versa), misclassified concept categories (stagnation as risk vs problem analysis), missing coverage of 5+ important edges directly supported by source text (mathematical prerequisites barrier, decision error relevance to safety, personal fluency gap), and one node that should be deleted as redundant (Design AI agents). After applying all proposed fixes—removing problematic edges, reclassifying nodes, adding 7 missing concept nodes and 1 missing intervention node, merging 2 duplicate nodes, and adding all required rationale fields—the knowledge fabric would accurately capture both primary pathways (technical InfraBayes benefits → adoption pathway, and exposition accessibility → adoption pathway) with proper causal flow and comprehensive coverage of source evidence."
