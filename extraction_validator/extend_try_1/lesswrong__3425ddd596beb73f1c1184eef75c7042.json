    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates good structural understanding of PSE's core framework and causal logic, with all major concept nodes and intervention nodes present and mostly properly connected. However, the extraction has critical schema compliance failures: all nodes lack required 'node_rationale' fields, intervention nodes lack 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' fields, and all edges lack 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields, violating mandatory JSON requirements. Additionally, the graph is missing 8 significant concept nodes and edges that represent important aspects of the source text (deceptive alignment in simulators, unconditioned partial simulator benefits, retrofit capabilities, human cognitive limits, automated alignment acceleration, and Cartesian formalization). The intervention lifecycle classification for the main PSE deployment node is misaligned with source text—the proposal is theoretical (lifecycle 4 or 1) not deployed (lifecycle 5). After systematic application of all proposed fixes, the extraction would achieve valid, mergeable, and complete coverage of the source knowledge fabric."

Should be lifecycle=4 (Pre-Deployment Testing) or lifecycle=1 (Model Design).",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Missing concept node for deceptive alignment pattern in simulators - explicitly stated in Recap: 'If this box was a deceitful box, it would just hide the bad objects under good ones such that it looked like a good box (deceptive alignment)'. This is core to understanding risk landscape.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Missing concept node for unconditioned partial simulator benefit - central mechanism stated in Infeasibility: 'The smaller model conducting the partial simulation needn't be aligned at all, and probably shouldn't be subject to conditioning. This way you can use an unconditioned simulator to elicit more aligned behavior from a more powerful simulator'. Without this node, PSE's core innovation is incompletely represented.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Missing intervention node for training partial simulator without conditioning - prerequisite design choice not captured. Must exist as intervention lifecycle=2.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Missing intervention node for PSE retrofit to existing models - explicitly mentioned in Introduction as key advantage: 'application to already trained (as well as yet to be trained) models might be possible without architectural or training data modifications'. Important for practical deployment pathway.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Missing concept node for Cartesian frame formalization - Recap section extensively describes Cartesian objects as mathematical structure underlying entire framework. Essential for understanding complexity modeling.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Missing concept node for automated alignment acceleration - Extrapolation section states: 'Such a risk reduction could be what is needed to navigate an initial risk period and develop more aligned systems via automated alignment'. Represents downstream benefit.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Missing concept node for human cognitive limits providing natural safety - PSE section: 'humans are incapable of conducting dangerous internal simulations as a result of the limited capacity of our simulator (the human brain)'. Provides theoretical motivation for complexity-reduction approach.",

E.g., edge between 'smaller models pose lower manipulation threat' and 'self-contained two-model architecture' (edge 7) scored confidence=3 but needs edge_confidence_rationale explaining 'Strong' rating with source evidence from Infeasibility section.",
      "EDGE QUALITY: Several edges have confidence=2 indicating light inference per Step 3 requirements, but Step 4 requires confidence=1 or 2 be marked with inference application in rationale. E.g., edges 4,6,13,14,15 need explicit inference documentation.",
      "VALIDATION COMPLETE: After application of 21 proposed field additions and 1 lifecycle correction, extraction would achieve: (1) complete schema compliance, (2) coverage of all major causal-interventional pathways from source, (3) inclusion of missing concept and intervention nodes, (4) proper referential integrity, (5) appropriate confidence levels with justifications, (6) traceability to source sections throughout. Graph would be mergeable with other 500k sources using consistent naming patterns."
