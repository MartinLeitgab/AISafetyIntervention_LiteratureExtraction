    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph contains valid core structure with 18 interconnected nodes forming coherent causal-interventional pathways from operational bottlenecks through automation and delegation approaches to concrete interventions. However, the extraction has multiple BLOCKER-level schema violations: missing required 'embedding' field removal, absent 'node_rationale' and 'edge_confidence_rationale'/'edge_rationale' fields across all entries, and incomplete intervention maturity justifications. Coverage analysis reveals 4 significant missing concept nodes (recruitment strategy, board meeting streamlining, metrics prioritization failure, research capacity constraints) and 2 missing intervention nodes that are extractable from source material. Critical rationale mismatches include overstated OKR maturity and incomplete linkage of operational improvements back to the Friendly AI research mission stated in source opening. The graph will require substantial modifications to add missing required fields and 6 new nodes to achieve schema compliance and complete causal-interventional pathways."

      "MAJOR-1: Missing concept node 'Lack of executive time allocation to metrics development planning' - source explicitly states: 'I failed to set up deadlines for concrete progress on developing metrics and experiments' (section: As a result, we didn't make much progress on metrics and experimentation)",
      "MAJOR-2: Missing concept node for board meeting streamlining improvement - source describes: 'We streamlined our Board meetings and reduced their frequency by providing the Board with a monthly snapshot update in PDF' (section: Capacity-building at MIRI in 2013)",
      "MAJOR-3: Missing concept node 'Research capacity constraints at MIRI from insufficient operations foundation' - source frames operations as prerequisite: 'Our research capacity will be discussed in a later post' indicating instrumental relationship to research mission (section: Capacity-building at MIRI in 2013)",
      "MAJOR-4: Missing intervention node 'Recruit and retain technically skilled operations personnel' - source identifies as alternative approach: 'I could have, by mid-2012, recognized our ongoing need for technically-savvy operations support, and recruited more aggressively' (section: These operational improvements consumed too much executive time)",
      "MAJOR-5: Missing intervention node 'Establish regular deadlines and prioritization for metrics development' - source lists as improvement: 'I'm setting up regular deadlines for concrete increments of progress on the development of metrics and experiments' (section: What I'm doing to improve)",
      "MAJOR-6: Incomplete causal linkage to AI safety research mission - source opens with 'It's been 8 months since our big strategic shift to a focus on Friendly AI research' but no node explicitly connects operational improvements to enabling Friendly AI research capacity",
      "MAJOR-7: Incorrect edge direction from 'Delegation and outsourcing' (theoretical insight) to 'Centralize operations' (design rationale) via 'mitigated_by' - should be design rationale implementing the insight",
      "RATIONALE MISMATCH-1: Intervention 'Implement OKRs and KPIs' assigned maturity=2 but source states 'Right now we're experimenting with... we have a lot more work to do' indicating maturity=1 (Foundational) (section: As a result, we didn't make much progress on metrics and experimentation)",
      "RATIONALE MISMATCH-2: Edge confidence=2 for OKR/KPI validation evidence is appropriate but rationale states 'Early OKR adoption expected to enhance capacity; limited evidence so far' - this should explicitly note the very early experimental stage rather than suggesting eventual validation",
      "COVERAGE ANALYSIS: 10 of 23 expected edges identified in source are covered; 4 partially covered; 9 missing entirely. Most significant gaps are infrastructure improvements (board meetings, security, MIRIvolunteers.org outcomes, visa exemption impact)",
      "MERGEABILITY CHECK: Node 'Process automation with software reduces operational workload' (theoretical insight) and 'Adopt modern SaaS tools for core operations' (design rationale) exhibit excessive semantic overlap - first node describes how something works (abstract), second describes what to do (concrete), but both express same basic concept at different abstraction levels. These should merge to avoid duplicate edges and maintain fabric clarity across 500k sources",
      "COVERAGE OF EXPLICIT RECOMMENDATIONS: Source section 'What I'm doing to improve' specifies three actions but only one is captured as intervention node. Missing: (1) 'more aggressively delegating and outsourcing tasks' - exists but should be structured as specific intervention with deadline/timeline; (2) 'prioritizing development of metrics' - completely missing as intervention",
      "EVIDENCE QUALITY: Most implementation mechanism nodes (Harvest, Basecamp, DonorTools, ZenPayroll) are validated with specific product names and contexts, enabling good mergeability across sources. However, validation evidence node 'Observed ability to execute more projects' is overly vague - source provides comparative statement ('compared to mid-2012, it is noticeably easier to just get things done') but lacks quantitative metrics, which is precisely what source identifies as organizational gap"
