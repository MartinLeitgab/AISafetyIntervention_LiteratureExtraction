    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has valid JSON structure and captures all major causal-interventional pathways from the DATA_SOURCE with complete node coverage and proper referential integrity. However, it violates schema requirements by missing three mandatory rationale fields (edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale, node_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale) on all nodes and edges. Additionally, several edge confidence ratings are underestimated (should be 3-4 instead of 2) where source text explicitly frames relationships, and intervention lifecycle/maturity assignments lack documented justification. The graph correctly covers all six expected causal-interventional edges and successfully decomposes the Vingean reflection framework into white-box component nodes rather than monolithic concepts. With the proposed field additions and confidence adjustments, the extraction becomes fully compliant with schema requirements and accurately represents the DATA_SOURCE content."

      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: All nodes and edges present required core fields (name, type, description, concept_category/lifecycle/maturity). However, instructions explicitly require edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale, and node_rationale in final_output_format; these are present in template but completely absent in extraction.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All 10 edges reference 9 nodes; all references match exactly. No orphaned nodes detected. Node-edge connections form single connected component with no isolated subgraphs.",
      "COVERAGE VALIDATION: All six major causal pathways from DATA_SOURCE are captured: (1) unpredictability→abstract reasoning via Deep Blue example, (2) abstract reasoning→Vingean reflection, (3) Vingean reflection→quantifier reasoning (explicit), (4) Vingean reflection→embedded predicates (explicit), (5) both mechanisms→Deep Blue validation, (6) validation→three interventions. Source states 'Vingean reflection can also be seen as the study of how a given agent wants thinking to occur...If these two coincide, we say the agent is reflectively stable' - this relationship between 'wanting' and 'actual thinking' is properly captured in nodes but rationale fields are missing documentation.",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT: Current ratings of '2' appear conservative. Source explicitly states 'Deep Blue's programmers...Instead, by reasoning about the way Deep Blue was searching through game trees, they arrived at a well-justified but abstract belief that Deep Blue was trying to win' - this direct connection between unpredictability and abstract reasoning warrants confidence 3+. Similarly, 'this appears as the rule that we should talk about our successor's actions only inside of quantifiers' explicitly connects design rationale to implementation mechanism, warranting confidence 4. Current edges 1,4,5 should be raised from 2 to 3-4.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY: All three interventions assigned maturity '2' but source provides only theoretical discussion with one anecdotal example. Source states frameworks are 'presently the main line of research trying to slowly get started on formalizing' - indicates foundational stage (maturity 1). Intervention 3 lifecycle assignment to '4 Pre-Deployment Testing' is reasonable since quantifier-based verification applies to testing phase, but maturity should be 1 not 2 due to lack of implemented systems.",
      "DECOMPOSITION: Framework properly decomposed into white-box components: Vingean reflection→quantifier-reasoning (explicit) + embedded predicates (explicit), avoiding monolithic node naming. This follows instructions for framework decomposition.",
      "FRAMEWORK REFERENCES: Source references additional resources (Arbital links, PDF papers) and identifies ongoing research line but does not describe implemented systems or experimental validations. All interventions therefore qualify as foundational/theoretical (maturity 1), not experimental/PoC (maturity 2).",
      "MISSING CRITICAL EDGES: Analysis reveals no missing edges - all relationships explicitly stated or strongly implied in source are captured.",
      "DATA SOURCE EVIDENCE: Direct quotes supporting major nodes: 'when an agent is designing another agent (or modifying its own code), it needs to approve the other agent's design without knowing the other agent's exact future actions' (risk), 'without knowing Deep Blue's exact moves against Kasparov...Instead, by reasoning about the way Deep Blue was searching' (validation), 'we should talk about our successor's actions only inside of quantifiers' (implementation mechanism), 'If these two coincide, we say the agent is reflectively stable' (design rationale)."
