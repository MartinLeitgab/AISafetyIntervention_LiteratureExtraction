    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has critical structural violations: intervention nodes have outgoing edges (violating fabric design rules), incomplete node attributes (missing rationale fields and section references), orphaned concept nodes (corrigibility research disconnected from main paths), and significant coverage gaps (fails to capture 8 of 14 major relationships from source). JSON schema has extraneous 'embedding' fields and missing required rationale fields. However, the core pathways connecting convergent instrumental goals → quantilizers and the institutional research expansion are sound. After applying proposed fixes (deletion of orphaned nodes, restoration of proper edge directionality, addition of 10 new nodes capturing institutional and dissemination mechanisms, completion of required fields, and edge additions connecting all major source topics), the extraction will achieve complete knowledge fabric with all risks connected to interventions through proper intermediate concept nodes."

      "BLOCKER 1: Edge from 'Adopt quantilizer decision rule' (intervention) to 'Provide dedicated funding' (intervention) violates core instruction: 'All nodes building the rationale for a proposed intervention MUST flow into the intervention node, NOT out of the intervention node.' Intervention nodes must only receive edges, not emit them (except refinements). Status: REQUIRES FIX via edge deletion and restructuring.",
      "BLOCKER 2: Edge from 'Integrate convergent instrumental goal analysis' (intervention) to 'Provide dedicated funding' (intervention) has same directionality violation. Status: REQUIRES FIX via edge deletion.",
      "BLOCKER 3: Missing required node attributes across all nodes: 'node_rationale' field absent from concepts; 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' absent from interventions. JSON schema requires these per output_format specification. Status: REQUIRES FIX via field additions with section references.",
      "BLOCKER 4: Extraneous 'embedding' fields in all nodes and edges not part of required schema. Status: REQUIRES FIX via field removal.",
      "MAJOR 5: Missing required edge attributes: all 13 edges lack 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields per output schema. Status: REQUIRES FIX via field additions with DATA_SOURCE section references.",
      "MAJOR 6: Orphaned concept node 'Formal agent modelling with logical frameworks for corrigibility' cannot connect to primary fabric. Source lists this under 'New at IAFF' section without connecting to convergent goals or quantilizer pathways. Per instructions: 'If isolated nodes cannot be connected to the fabric even with modest inference, remove them.' Status: REQUIRES DELETION.",
      "MAJOR 7: Coverage gap: Source documents Scott Garrabrant joining MIRI full-time research team but this research capacity event is not captured in knowledge fabric. Should create 'Research capacity expansion in AI safety' concept and connect to team-building pathway. Status: REQUIRES ADD per coverage analysis.",
      "MAJOR 8: Coverage gap: UK collaboration and seminar activities described in General updates section are not represented in fabric. 'Big-Picture Thinking seminar' led by Andrew Critch represents concrete research coordination implementation. Status: REQUIRES ADD via new coordination implementation node.",
      "MAJOR 9: Coverage gap: $15 million Leverhulme Centre establishment and SAIRC job announcements (News and links) are mentioned as context but not integrated into interventions chain. Should connect to 'Institutional infrastructure' design rationale and funding intervention. Status: REQUIRES ADD and edge creation.",
      "MAJOR 10: Coverage gap: Public recognition of safety researchers (Bostrom in Foreign Policy top 100, Washington Post series) represents validation of risk characterization but is disconnected from fabric. Status: REQUIRES ADD of 'Public awareness' validation node.",
      "MAJOR 11: Coverage gap: Viktoriya Krakanova's work on risks without intelligence explosion expands risk characterization beyond singularity scenarios but is isolated. Status: REQUIRES ADD of expanded risk characterization node.",
      "MAJOR 12: Coverage gap: 2014 MIRI-FHI paper republication in 'Risks of Artificial Intelligence' anthology with Dewey and advisor contributions represents amplification mechanism not captured. Status: REQUIRES ADD of publication amplification node.",
      "MAJOR 13: Intervention maturity assessment: 'Adopt quantilizer decision rule' marked as maturity 2 (Experimental/PoC) but source presents only theoretical paper announcement with no implementation evidence. Per instructions, theoretical work = maturity 1. Status: REQUIRES CHANGE to maturity 1.",
      "MAJOR 14: Intervention maturity assessment: 'Integrate convergent instrumental goal analysis into safety assessment tools' presents moderate inference (application to assessment context not explicit in source). Per instructions, moderate inference + no empirical validation = maturity 1. Status: REQUIRES CHANGE to maturity 1.",
      "MINOR 15: Node 'Provide dedicated funding and institutional support for AI safety research centres' conflates three distinct concepts: (1) funding mechanisms, (2) institutional infrastructure, (3) centre establishment. Should decompose into separate nodes. Status: REQUIRES RESTRUCTURING via proposed merges and new node additions.",
      "MINOR 16: Edge 'addressed_by' from risk to intervention violates fabric design which requires intermediate concept nodes. Edge from 'Existential catastrophe' to 'Provide dedicated funding' skips all intermediate reasoning. Status: REQUIRES FIX via reconstruction with intermediate nodes.",
      "COVERAGE 1: Source explicitly connects quantilizer and convergent goals papers to AAAI-16 workshop acceptance, enabling publication dissemination. This validation evidence → publication mechanism → adoption pathway is missing. Status: REQUIRES ADD of dissemination mechanism nodes and edges.",
      "COVERAGE 2: Source describes coordination (UK visit, seminar) as concrete implementation of multi-institutional collaboration. This implementation mechanism is not captured. Status: REQUIRES ADD of coordination implementation node.",
      "COVERAGE 3: Source reports multiple research centres and 4 named positions being hired across institutions (MIRI, FHI, Cambridge CSER). This coordinated research capacity building is not in fabric. Status: REQUIRES ADD of capacity development nodes.",
      "COVERAGE 4: Extraction completely misses institutional infrastructure pathway: (risk of misalignment) → (need for research capacity) → (institutional funding) → (centre establishment) → (team building). This is major 'News and links' theme. Status: REQUIRES ADDITION of 5+ nodes and edges."
