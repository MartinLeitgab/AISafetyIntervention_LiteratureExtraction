However, the extraction has four critical blockers: (1) all nodes lack required 'node_rationale' field explaining fabric importance, (2) all intervention nodes have null values for 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale', (3) all edges lack required 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields, and (4) several major concept nodes and edges are missing, including the research exponent φ parameter, Type II singularity conditions with ρ>0, task replacement dynamics, and AI safety risk pathways. The intervention node names lack sufficient implementation specificity for cross-source mergeability. These issues must be corrected before the knowledge graph can be considered valid for downstream AI safety analysis."

These should be in node descriptions.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY LEVELS: All four interventions assigned maturity=2 (Experimental/Proof-of-Concept) but lack evidence for this level. Section §5.4 suggests innovation policies are established practice (maturity 3-4), while sustainability caps are more novel (maturity 1-2). Should differentiate.",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE SPECIFICITY: All interventions assigned lifecycle=5 (Deployment) but task-creation incentives and innovation mechanisms should start at lifecycle=1-2 (design) or lifecycle=3 (policy pre-deployment). Sustainability regulations naturally map to 5. Should vary.",
      "MERGEABILITY ISSUE - Intervention node names: Current names like 'Implement task-creation incentive policies' could merge with nearly identical phrasing across sources, losing distinction between context-specific interventions. Enhanced names like 'Implement government R&D tax credits and grants for human-complementary task creation during AI workforce transitions' include sufficient context for proper merging.",
      "ISOLATED CONCEPT CANDIDATES - Production function ρ regime: This fundamental theoretical parameter is referenced throughout (§3.2, §3.3, §4.2, §4.4, §5.2) but has no dedicated node in current extraction. Creates fragmented reasoning paths.",
      "VALIDATED COVERAGE: Four primary causal-interventional pathways are correctly identified and structured: (1) wage stagnation pathway with task-creation intervention, (2) innovation slowdown pathway with IP/subsidy intervention, (3) resource-constrained growth pathway with sustainability regulation, (4) saving-rate decline pathway with fiscal redistribution. These represent approximately 75% of major pathways from §3-5."
