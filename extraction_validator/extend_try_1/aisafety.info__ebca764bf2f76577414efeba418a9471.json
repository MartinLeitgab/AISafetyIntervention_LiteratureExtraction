However, the JSON is INVALID as-is due to BLOCKER-level schema violations: all 12 nodes are missing required node_rationale fields, and all 11 edges are missing required edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields. Additionally, critical causal pathways are under-represented: (1) the direct connection from spurious correlation risk to neuron-level visualization is missing, (2) feature interpolation research direction is not captured as nodes/edges despite explicit source discussion, and (3) temporal feature evolution tracking is absent despite being mentioned as key application. After applying proposed fixes (adding 3 nodes, 4 new edges, 2 modified edge confidences, and 15 field additions), the graph will achieve full schema compliance, represent 100% of major causal pathways from source, and be valid for merging across the 500k source corpus with consistent naming conventions."

      "BLOCKER SCHEMA VIOLATIONS: All nodes missing node_rationale field (required per schema). All edges missing edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields (required per schema). These must be added before output is valid.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 1: Spurious correlation risk not directly connected to neuron-level visualization intervention despite source establishing this connection: 'helps to isolate the causes of a model's classifications from mere correlations in the input data' and 'This could be a single neuron, a channel, or even a full layer' (main methodology section). Proposed edge: Spurious correlation → addressed_by → Neuron-level visualization.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 2: Feature interpolation research direction mentioned in source ('Some researchers have experimented with this using interpolation between neurons...if we add a black and white neuron to a mosaic neuron, we obtain a black and white version of the mosaic', Feature generation section) but completely absent from graph. Requires: (1) new theoretical insight node on feature interpolation, (2) new intervention node for interpolation studies, (3) edges connecting these to existing nodes.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 3: Temporal feature evolution tracking presented in source as key application ('It also helps us visualize how a network's understanding of a feature evolves through the course of the training process', main methodology section) but missing from graph. Requires: new validation evidence node on temporal evolution tracking.",
      "CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION: Edge from 'Reliance on correlational cues' to 'Neuron-level visualization' marked confidence=2 but source provides systematic evidence, should be confidence=3. Edge from 'Black-box hierarchies' to 'Optimizing inputs' marked confidence=3 but supported by explicit mechanism description, could justify confidence=4.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY REVIEW: 'Audit neural network features' marked maturity=2 (Experimental) but justified by DeepDream historical precedent and systematic worked example in source. Should be maturity=3 (Prototype/Pilot).",

Recommended enhancement in 'Use feature visualization' node rationale.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All edges checked - source_node and target_node names match existing node names exactly. No duplicate nodes identified. No orphaned nodes found after proposed additions.",
      "MERGABILITY ASSESSMENT: Node naming follows required patterns for 500k source merging (e.g., 'Feature visualization to interpret learned representations' uses canonical technical term + context pattern). Aliases provided (2-3 items) for cross-source matching.",
      "EXTRACTION COMPLETENESS: After fixes, graph captures 100% of explicit causal pathways from source: risk (opacity) → problem analysis (hierarchies, correlations) → theoretical insight (activation maximization, neuron inspection, interpolation) → design rationale (use feature visualization) → implementation (optimization by technique, temporal tracking) → validation (images, DeepDream, evolution) → interventions (pre-deployment audit, data refinement, interpolation studies).
