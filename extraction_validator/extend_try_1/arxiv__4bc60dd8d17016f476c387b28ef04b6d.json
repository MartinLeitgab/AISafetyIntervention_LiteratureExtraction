    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph is structurally sound and accurately represents the causal-interventional pathways through the empirical study, but has critical missing required fields that prevent schema compliance: all nodes lack 'node_rationale', all edges lack 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale', and intervention nodes lack 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale'. Additionally, three important validation evidence nodes are missing (distribution peaking, utility equivalence classes, decision-theoretic time cost), and several edges should be added to strengthen the fabric (e.g., connecting evaluation method to risk mitigation, linking Johnson theorem to washout effect). The fabric structure correctly flows from risks through six concept categories to interventions with appropriate intermediate reasoning, and demonstrates understanding of the paper's core contribution comparing inference methods via decision-theoretic evaluation. With implementation of proposed additions and field population, the graph would be valid and mergeable."
