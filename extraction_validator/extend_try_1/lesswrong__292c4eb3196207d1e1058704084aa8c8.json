    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has valid JSON structure and sound conceptual organization covering risks, problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, and validation evidence connected to three proposed interventions. However, multiple schema compliance issues must be corrected: all edges lack required 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields; all nodes lack required 'node_rationale' fields; intervention nodes lack required lifecycle and maturity rationale fields; and three critical edge directions are logically inverted (validation evidence should not validate implementation mechanisms, but rather motivate interventions). Additionally, the knowledge fabric has incomplete coverage of important findings from the source: missing nodes for iterative stacking attacks, GPT-4 robustness improvement, cross-language generalization of bypass attacks, and Claude resistance. These gaps should be filled to represent the complete vulnerability landscape presented in the source. The fabric is mergeable and conceptually sound once fixes are applied, with clear causal pathways from risks through mechanisms to interventions."
