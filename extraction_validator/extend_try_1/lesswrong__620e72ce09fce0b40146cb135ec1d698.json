Additionally, six important concept nodes are missing from the fabric that are explicitly discussed in the DATA_SOURCE (sequential vs discrete problem solving characteristics, prosaic vs brain-based AGI validation, deployment boundary ambiguity, subhuman AGI possibility, and architecture-specific safety requirements). The edge confidence values lack supporting rationales per schema specifications. With proposed fixes (adding required fields with DATA_SOURCE citations, removing extraneous fields, adding six missing nodes with proper edges), the extraction would achieve schema compliance and significantly improved coverage of the source material's reasoning pathways."

Schema requires 'edge_confidence_rationale: evidence assessment with closest preceding data source section title reference' and 'edge_rationale: connection justification with closest preceding data source section title reference'.",
      "MAJOR: Extraneous 'embedding' fields present on all nodes and some edges - not in schema specification, should be removed.",
      "MISSING NODE: 'Sequential decision problem solving characteristic of RL' - DATA_SOURCE 'Foundational learning algorithm' section explicitly discusses sequential decision dependency as core RL characteristic: 'turning left means I can turn left or right at the next junction while turning right would eventually lead me into a dead-end'. This is critical for users to understand RL-to-control mapping.",
      "MISSING NODE: 'Discrete independent decision problem solving characteristic of SL' - DATA_SOURCE explicitly contrasts: 'predicting 7 is causally independent of that fact the next training image is a 4'. This completes the SL/RL dichotomy.",
      "MISSING NODE: 'Validation evidence of prosaic vs brain-based AGI positioning' - DATA_SOURCE closing paragraph states framework 'accounts for different conceptualizations of AGI in safety research, such as prosaic AGI vs brain-based AGI' and positions them in the three-dimensional space. This is explicit validation evidence of framework utility.",
      "MISSING NODE: 'Architecture-dependent safety problems require architecture-specific interventions' - DATA_SOURCE 'Zooming back out' explicitly states: 'there are almost certainly going to be other important safety problems (and solutions) that end up being strictly architecture-specific' and 'In order to solve the AGI safety control problem, we need to solve all of these subproblems, architecture-independent and architecture-dependent alike.' This theoretical insight justifies architecture-specific controls.",
      "MISSING NODE: 'Deployment vs post-deployment learning boundary ambiguity' - DATA_SOURCE 'Post-deployment learning capacity' section discusses how high online learning makes the training/testing-deployment distinction 'increasingly arbitrary', creating a problem analysis.",
      "MISSING NODE: 'Subhuman AGI general intelligence possibility' - DATA_SOURCE 'Level of general intelligence' section explicitly addresses: 'nothing about this definition...necessarily entails superhuman competence' and provides dolphin/octopus/crow examples. This prevents false superhuman-only assumptions.",

Instructions require 'Every distinct claim, method, finding etc. that is part of any core reasoning pathways is extracted as a node' and 'approximately 15 nodes per 5000 words'. Current extraction has 12 nodes; with additions would reach 18 nodes, achieving target density.",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE: All edges rated 2-3 without detailed justification. Schema requires confidence scale: 5 (very strong/proofs), 4 (strong/controlled experiments), 3 (medium/systematic qualitative), 2 (weak/single examples), 1 (speculative). Most edges in this extraction are supported by explicit DATA_SOURCE reasoning (not single examples) and should support higher confidence ratings with proper justification.",

Required section titles include: 'Exploring the possible space of learning architectures', 'Foundational learning algorithm', 'Post-deployment learning capacity', 'Level of general intelligence', 'Zooming back out'."
