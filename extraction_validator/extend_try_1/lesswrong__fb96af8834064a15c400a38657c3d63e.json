Multiple edges assert connections not explicitly supported in the source text with insufficient confidence justification. Intervention maturity assessments are overstated given the theoretical stage of proposals. However, all referenced nodes exist with correct names, no orphaned nodes are present, and the overall causal structure maps correctly to the source's reasoning pathways once proposed fixes are applied. The fabric is valid and mergeable across 500k sources after applying the identified fixes."

      "EDGE RATIONALE DEFICIT: Edge from Log-loss to fine-tuning restriction claims log-loss 'motivates' but source motivation is indirect - log-loss validates that base training achieves simulation, which suggests (not explicitly motivates) fine-tuning may be unnecessary. Confidence correctly set to 2 but requires rationale field explaining this inference.",

Inference required with confidence 1-2.",
