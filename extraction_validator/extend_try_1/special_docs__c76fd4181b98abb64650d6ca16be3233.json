    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the primary causal pathway from computational complexity risk through experimental validation to design-phase interventions, with correct structural integrity and node connectivity. However, the extraction has BLOCKER-level schema compliance issues (missing required node_rationale, edge_rationale, and intervention rationale fields across all nodes and edges), one unsupported intervention node ('pruning during training') that must be removed, and incomplete coverage of secondary theoretical insights (multi-parameter complexity characterization and explicit rejection of motivation as limiting factor). With the proposed fixes applied—adding required fields with source citations, deleting the unsupported pruning intervention, and adding two concept nodes for theoretical completeness—the graph becomes valid, mergeable, and accurate to the source material."

      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE BLOCKER: All 8 nodes missing node_rationale field required by schema. All 7 edges missing edge_rationale and edge_confidence_rationale fields required by schema. Intervention nodes (6 and 7) missing intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale fields required by schema.",
      "EXTRACTION INTEGRITY ISSUE: Intervention node 'Apply treewidth-based pruning during planning and means selection in training' (nodes[7]) is not grounded in source text. Source contains no discussion of training-time pruning, dynamic goal restructuring, or agent learning procedures. This appears to be over-inferred and should be deleted.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 1: Source systematically evaluates multiple graph-theoretic predictors (expansion, diameter, path length) beyond treewidth, reporting significant correlations in 'Results' sections. Current extraction captures only treewidth as theoretical insight. Missing node for multi-parameter complexity characterization represents ~15% coverage gap.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 2: Source explicitly rejects motivation and skill as limiting factors in Introduction ('Most psychological theories attribute people's failure...exclusively to insufficient motivation or lack of skill. Here, we offer a complementary explanation') and demonstrates this empirically across all three experiments. Missing concept node for 'cognitive tractability limits distinct from motivation' weakens the problem analysis layer.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All node names in edge source_node and target_node fields match exactly with node names in nodes array. No referential errors.",
      "ORPHAN CHECK: All 8 nodes participate in connected causal pathway. No orphaned nodes.",
      "DUPLICATE CHECK: No duplicate nodes or edges identified.",
      "BEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENTS VALIDATION: Source provides rigorous empirical support across three independent experiments. Experiment 1 (n=625 after exclusion): treewidth explained 44.9% variance (r=−0.59, p=0.0058); Experiment 2 (n=522 after exclusion): treewidth explained 20.4% variance (r=−0.4828, p=0.0311); Experiment 3 (n=600): treewidth showed strongest correlation (r=−0.756, p=0.0001). These findings strongly validate the validation evidence node.",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE ASSIGNMENT: Extracted intervention 1 assigned lifecycle=1 (Model Design) is appropriate since source discusses designing goal systems but provides no AI implementation details. Source states 'the tasks were relatively abstract' (Experiment 3 intro) and discusses only human behavioral experiments.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY ASSIGNMENT: Extracted intervention 1 assigned maturity=2 (Experimental/Proof-of-Concept) is appropriate. No deployed AI systems tested; only controlled human experiments with synthetic goal networks. Transfer to AI agents is theoretical extrapolation.",
      "CONFIDENCE ASSIGNMENTS: Edge confidence levels are appropriately calibrated. Edges specifying NP-hardness mapping (confidence 4) and experimental validation (confidence 4) rest on strong theoretical grounding and rigorous empirical evidence. Edges inferring implementation and design approaches (confidence 2-3) involve moderate inference appropriate for knowledge fabric construction from academic sources."
