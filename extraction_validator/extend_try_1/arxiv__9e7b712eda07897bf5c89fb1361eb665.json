    "summary": "The knowledge graph extraction is valid in structure and referential integrity but contains BLOCKER-level violations of mandatory edge constraints requiring immediate correction: two edges directly connect validation/prototype nodes to intervention nodes, which violates the explicit requirement that all paths flow through intermediate concept nodes. Additionally, multiple required fields are missing (node_rationale, edge_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale) per the specified output format. The extracted fabric captures the core reasoning path from fragmented know-how risks through formal methods design to DSS prototype deployment, but misses important intermediate theoretical insights about modularity and scalability that bridge validation evidence to the proposed global model intervention. After applying the proposed fixes including edge deletions, field additions, and new intermediate nodes, the extraction will be valid, complete, and mergeable across data sources."
