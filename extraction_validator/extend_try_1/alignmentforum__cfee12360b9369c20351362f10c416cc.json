Most severely: (1) Missing required fields on all nodes and edges (node_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale), (2) Three 'validation evidence' nodes represent no actual evidence from the source—the data source is a theoretical framework paper containing only pedagogical examples, not empirical studies, (3) Three intervention nodes are inferred without explicit support from the source and should be marked as foundational/theoretical (maturity 1), (4) Missing two important concept nodes about treacherous turns and universal prior malignancy that are explicitly discussed in the source. The graph captures the core conceptual structure correctly but violates schema requirements and contains unsupported nodes. After applying proposed fixes (deleting ungrounded validation nodes, adding missing concept nodes, downgrading intervention maturity, and adding all required fields with proper citations), the extraction would be valid and mergeable."

      "BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: Schema requires node_rationale field on ALL nodes (lines in instructions: 'node_rationale: why essential to fabric with closest preceding data source section title reference'). Every extracted node lacks this field.",
      "BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: Schema requires intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale on intervention nodes. All three intervention nodes (16-18) lack these required fields.",
      "BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: Schema requires edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale on ALL edges. No edges in extraction contain these fields.",
      "CRITICAL CONTENT ISSUE: Data source explicitly states at top 'Note: I now consider this post deprecated and instead recommend this updated version.' Extraction is from deprecated version but proceeds as if authoritative.",
      "CRITICAL CONTENT ISSUE: Validation evidence nodes (13-15) claim empirical studies and experiments. Source contains NONE. Text uses hypothetical phrases 'imagine V and E', 'imagine U is integer uniform', 'Imagine you were to sample k points' — these are pedagogical illustrations, not validation evidence. Per instructions: 'confidence must be 2 if light inference applied' — but these nodes represent no evidence at all, they are fiction.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Source explicitly discusses 'Treacherous Turn' as application of Level 3: 'Level 3 is also the mechanism behind a superintelligent AI making a Treacherous Turn. Here, V is doing what the human's want forever. U is doing what the humans want before in the training cases where the AI does not have enough power to take over, and W is whatever the AI wants to do with the universe.' This is NOT extracted as a concept node.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Source explicitly discusses 'malignancy of the universal prior' as application of Level 3: 'Finally, Level 3 is also behind the malignancy of the universal prior, where you want to predict well forever (V), so hypotheses might predict well for a while (U), so that they can manipulate the world with their future predictions (W).' This concept is missing.",
      "INFERENCE ISSUE: Three intervention nodes (16-18) are inferred without explicit source support. Source is theoretical framework, not implementation guide. Per instructions: interventions inferred should be 'marked as lower maturity (must be 1 or 2)'. Current extraction has maturity 1-3, which is inconsistent.",
      "INFERENCE DOCUMENTATION: Current extraction provides maturity/lifecycle justifications only in edge confidence assessment, not in required intervention_maturity_rationale field. Instructions require these on the node itself with 'evidence-based reasoning with closest preceding data source section title reference'.",
      "EDGE DOCUMENTATION: All edges lack required edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields. For example, edge 'Regression to mean caused_by Proxy objective divergence' should cite: 'Goodhart's Curse Level 1 (regressing to the mean): When we select for points with a high U value, we will be biased towards points for which U is an overestimate of V.' (from 'Goodhart's Curse Level 1' section)",
      "VALIDATION: Referential integrity check PASSES — all source/target nodes in edges exist in node list. No orphaned nodes detected (though validation evidence nodes should be orphaned).",
      "STRUCTURAL ISSUE: Knowledge fabric paths violate instruction to 'ALWAYS end paths with the intervention node, NEVER create edges going out of intervention nodes'. Current extraction has zero edges outbound from interventions (correct) but also zero edges INBOUND to interventions from validation evidence after deletions recommended.",
      "POST-FIX STATUS: After applying proposed fixes (delete 3 unsupported validation nodes and their edges, add 2 missing concept nodes with edges, add all required fields to nodes and edges, downgrade intervention maturity to 1), the extraction would form valid fabric connecting Goodhart's curse risk through three problem mechanisms to three design rationales to three implementation mechanisms to concrete interventions, plus two additional application areas (treacherous turn, universal prior). Path completeness: Risk → Problem Analysis (3 branches) → Theoretical Insights (3 branches) → Design Rationales (3 branches) → Implementation Mechanisms (3 branches) → Interventions (3 endpoints). Additional path: Problem Analysis (Level 3) → Application in Treacherous Turn. Additional path: Problem Analysis (Level 3) → Application in Universal Prior."
