Additionally, the extraction underperforms on coverage—it misses 4 important implementation mechanisms and design elements present in the source: (1) candidate expertise requirements as validation evidence, (2) proactive discovery as a distinct implementation mechanism, (3) multi-year employment commitment as a design rationale for expertise development, and (4) workplace infrastructure enabling high-bandwidth communication. The intervention is misclassified as lifecycle 6 (Other) when it should be 5 (Deployment); maturity should be 3 (Prototype/Pilot) not 2 (Experimental) given the probationary hiring process described. With all proposed fixes applied, the knowledge fabric becomes complete, schema-compliant, and mergeable."
