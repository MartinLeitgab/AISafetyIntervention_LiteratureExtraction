    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph is structurally valid JSON with correct referential integrity, but has BLOCKER-level schema violations: missing required node_rationale fields in all nodes and missing edge_confidence_rationale/edge_rationale fields in all edges per the specified schema. The conceptual fabric is sound and captures the primary causal path from AI misalignment risk through interpretability to research funding, but undershoots extraction completeness by omitting the critical longtermism-framing concept that contextualizes the entire research effort. Edge confidence levels are appropriately conservative but could be moderately elevated based on the systematic nature of the published scenario analysis. The intervention node requires corrections to lifecycle (1 instead of 6) and maturity (2 instead of 1) to accurately reflect research-stage interventions. After applying the proposed schema fixes, node additions, and edge field completions, the knowledge fabric will be valid, mergeable, and sufficiently connected to downstream AI safety analysis."
