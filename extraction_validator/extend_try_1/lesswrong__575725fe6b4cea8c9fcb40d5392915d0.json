    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates strong structural understanding of the source material and captures the primary reasoning pathways from AGI extinction risk through alignment challenges to proposed interventions. However, the extraction has critical schema compliance failures (missing required rationale fields), incomplete coverage of important reasoning paths (narrow AI convergence, catch-22 epistemic problem, single-deployment constraint), several missing intermediate nodes that would make the fabric more complete and comprehensible, and incorrect edge directionality in the cryptography evidence connection. The intervention maturity levels are overstated (should be 1, not 2). When these issues are corrected via the proposed fixes, the knowledge graph becomes valid, mergeable across sources, and properly captures the complete reasoning fabric from risks through theoretical insights to actionable pre-deployment interventions."

      "MAJOR - Coverage Gap: Section 'Why can't we use continuity' explains sharp capability discontinuities as WHY subhuman tests have limited validity. This theoretical insight is completely missing, leaving the validation evidence node disconnected from its foundational justification.",
      "MAJOR - Coverage Gap: Section 'Can't we experiment on sub-human intelligences?' establishes that 'We might not even get a single retry' - this single-deployment constraint is crucial justification for pre-deployment red-teaming but absent from extraction.",
      "MAJOR - Coverage Gap: The catch-22 ('We don't know what superintelligence will do until we run it, and it is dangerous to run it') is core to explaining why alignment is superhuman-difficulty problem, but extraction does not explicitly capture this paradox.",
      "MAJOR - Edge Directionality Error: Edge from 'Alignment scheme-breaking contests' to 'Cryptography adversarial testing' uses 'validated_by' - backwards. Cryptography success should support the design rationale FOR contests, not be validated BY them. Also, this causes both nodes to reference each other creating logical circularity.",
      "MAJOR - Intervention Maturity Overstated: Both interventions marked maturity=2 (Experimental/PoC) but source only proposes these as conceptual frameworks with no pilot studies, deployment history, or systematic validation. Should be maturity=1 per instruction that maturity requires empirical validation evidence.",
      "MINOR - Node Classification Error: 'Alignment scheme-breaking contests with human experts' is marked type='concept' with concept_category='implementation mechanism' but is actually describing a proposed intervention, not a concept node. Should be type='intervention'.",
      "MINOR - Node Classification Error: 'Iterative alignment testing on increasingly capable models' is marked type='concept' but appears to function as implementation mechanism for the intervention, creating classification ambiguity.",
      "Referential Integrity: All edge source and target node references successfully resolve. Connectivity is complete - no orphaned nodes.",
      "Source Evidence Validation: Core risk 'Extinction of humanity by misaligned AGI' is explicitly stated ('how AI is going to kill us all'). Problem analysis nodes (reward hacking, weak coordination) are directly quoted. Theoretical insight (security framing) and design rationales (red-teaming, subhuman testing) are clearly present. However, several supporting premises are underrepresented in the extracted graph density."
