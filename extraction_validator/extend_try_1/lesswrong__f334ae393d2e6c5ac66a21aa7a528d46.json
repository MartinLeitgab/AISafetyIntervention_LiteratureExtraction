    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has BLOCKER-level issues preventing valid JSON output: (1) missing required edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields from all 18 edges; (2) missing required node_rationale and intervention rationale fields from most nodes; (3) extraneous 'embedding' fields throughout; (4) unmerged duplicate nodes representing design_rationale and implementation_mechanism of same concept. Additionally, critical content gaps exist: no top-level risk node anchoring the fabric, missing edges connecting human cognition observations to interventions, and incomplete coverage of architectural constraints from source. The fabric flow violates instructions by having design_rationale and implementation_mechanism nodes operating as semi-isolated pairs rather than fully connected through validation evidence to interventions. After proposed fixes including adding 6 new concept nodes, merging 2 nodes, deleting 1 redundant node, adding 6 new edges, modifying 2 edge types, and adding all missing rationale fields, the extraction would correctly represent the source's reasoning pathways."
