The graph correctly identifies the core causal chain from 'Malicious use of LLMs' → 'Attribution inability' → 'Watermarking solution', but orphans the existential risk pathway and disconnects the logging intervention sub-fabric. After applying proposed fixes (adding 3 validation evidence nodes, completing all required fields, reconnecting orphaned pathways, and adjusting maturity levels to match prototype-stage evidence), the graph becomes valid and mergeable with other AI safety knowledge fabrics."

Current extraction omits these entirely, making traceability impossible for downstream fabric merging. All edges reference DATA_SOURCE sections but lack the required_rationale fields.",
      "BLOCKER 2: Intervention node fields 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' completely missing per schema. Maturity assignments (e.g., watermark at 2, backdoor at 1) lack supporting evidence citations.",
      "ORPHAN: 'Logs provide ground truth...' validation evidence node exists but lacks incoming edges from design rationale. Current graph shows only logging → intervention but missing the upstream chain from problem through rationale.",
      "ORPHAN: Entire 'Emergent deception' → 'Lack of tractable programs' pathway disconnected from main watermarking fabric. These discuss existential risk and gradualism but do not mechanistically connect to watermarking/logging/backdoor interventions, violating mandatory fabric connectivity.",
      "MISMATCH 1: Alias 'Aaronson–Kirchner watermark algorithm' unsupported. DATA_SOURCE ('Watermarking language model outputs' section) states 'Jan Hendrik Kirchner...implemented a prototype' but credits only Aaronson with algorithm invention.",
      "MISMATCH 2: Validation evidence node claims 'high detection...reliability' but prototype is described as not-yet-deployed ('has not yet been rolled out to the production server') and Aaronson says maturity questions about the next intervention ('I could probably spend five or ten years just on this watermarking problem').",
      "COVERAGE: Graph successfully captures edges for watermarking algorithm (r^{1/p} sampling), backdoor hardness (planted clique), gradualism principle, and logging sub-paths. Missing edges: explicit connection between empirical misuse observations and motivation for watermarking; N-gram selection tradeoff node; robustness demonstration to deployment.",
      "INFERENCE APPLICATION: Nodes like 'Empirical observation of AI misuse patterns in practice' inferred from multiple source statements ('every student...will be tempted', 'nation states and corporations will be generating propaganda') with high confidence (4-5 range); backdoor intervention inferred at lower maturity (1) because only theoretical, no implementation.",
      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: All 20 nodes and 19 edges possess required base fields (name, type, description for concepts; lifecycle/maturity for interventions; type/source/target/confidence for edges). Missing derivative fields block valid JSON schema validation for downstream tools but JSON itself parses validly."
