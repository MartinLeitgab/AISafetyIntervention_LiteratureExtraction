Additionally, the causal directionality of the first edge is reversed, and the knowledge fabric is incomplete—missing significant nodes and edges that represent critical source content including AED team initiative, EA infrastructure support, and the five-point user engagement model. After applying proposed fixes (adding 3 new concept nodes, reversing 1 edge, populating all required rationale fields, adding 4 new edges, and enhancing node descriptions), the extraction would achieve valid schema compliance and comprehensive coverage of the data source's knowledge fabric."
