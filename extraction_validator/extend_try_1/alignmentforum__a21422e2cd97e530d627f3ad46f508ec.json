    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the primary reasoning pathway from deceptive alignment risk through understanding-based evaluation design, but exhibits critical schema deficiencies and incomplete coverage of source nuance. All nodes and edges lack required rationale fields (node_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale), violating mandatory schema requirements. The extraction oversimplifies interpretability techniques into a monolithic node rather than capturing source's detailed critique of causal scrubbing, auditing games, and prediction-based approaches as distinct failure modes. Eight key concept nodes are missing, including the critical formalizing-understanding-as-open-problem node and the detection-vs-prevention asymmetry insight. Four edges fail to capture source-supported connections. After applying proposed fixes (adding 7 nodes, merging 1 node, deleting 1 node, deleting 1 edge, and adding comprehensive rationale fields), the extraction becomes valid, complete, and mergeable across domains."

      "MAJOR: Coverage gap - detection-vs-prevention asymmetry (core argument) not captured as dedicated concept node. DATA_SOURCE: 'checking for deceptive alignment might be harder than avoiding it...checking for deception in a model requires going up against a highly capable adversary that is attempting to evade detection, while preventing deception from arising in the first place doesn't necessarily require that'",
      "MAJOR: Coverage gap - method-agnosticism preventing lock-in to mechanistic interpretability not explicitly represented as design rationale node. DATA_SOURCE: 'we don't want to bake in any particular way of producing model understanding...I'm really not asking for a mechanistic-interpretability-based standard'",
      "MAJOR: Oversimplification - 'Combination of interpretability techniques' node treats causal scrubbing, auditing games, prediction-based methods as undifferentiated toolkit, but source critically distinguishes each with specific failure modes: scrubbing (sufficiency/necessity gap), auditing games (tool evaluation not model understanding), prediction (non-transferability)",
      "MAJOR: Coverage gap - formalizing understanding as open technical problem not captured. DATA_SOURCE: 'it's very unclear what it would look like to be able to prove that you understand your model, which is obviously a major blocker...What we need, therefore, is some way of formalizing what it would mean to demonstrate that you understand some model'",
      "MAJOR: Coverage gap - behavioral evaluations' continued value for discovering first deceptive models not captured. DATA_SOURCE: 'could be especially useful early on as a way to find the first example of a deceptively aligned model, which could then be studied extensively'",
      "MINOR: Edge type accuracy - edge[1] uses 'mitigated_by' but source framing suggests 'addressed_by' more appropriate for theoretical insight addressing problem analysis",
      "MINOR: Orphaned validation evidence nodes - 'Cross-industry norm' and 'Current interpretability techniques' nodes have weak connection justification; cross-industry norm references external sources (Ezra Klein, John Oliver) not primary source analysis",
