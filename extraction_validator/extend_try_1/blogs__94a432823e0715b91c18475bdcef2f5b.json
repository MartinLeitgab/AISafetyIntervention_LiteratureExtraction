    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the core reasoning pathways from the identified risk (misallocation of AI safety resources) through problem analysis (correlated answers driven by doom bias) to proposed interventions (structured surveys and scenario analysis). However, the extraction has schema violations (missing required rationale fields, undocumented embedding fields), incomplete coverage of related cognitive biases mentioned in the source, and insufficient rigor in edge confidence justifications. The node-to-edge referential integrity is sound, but concept categorizations need adjustment to align with the speculative nature of the source material. After applying the proposed fixes (adding nodes for related biases and cognitive mechanisms, adjusting concept categories, adding all required rationale fields, and removing extraneous fields), the knowledge graph will be valid and mergeable across the 500k datasource collection."
