JSON is structurally valid but incomplete per instructions. After proposed fixes (adding 6 required field attributes to all nodes/edges, correcting edge types, upgrading intervention maturity to 3, adding mixed-results validation node to capture trade-offs), the graph would accurately represent the complete causal-interventional pathway from positional encoding reliability risk through design rationale to empirically-validated intervention with proper nuance on limitations."
