    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the core causal-interventional pathway from inefficient voting outcomes through Gibbard's limitation to ranked lists, to the theoretical insight that latent-space vectors escape this limitation, to proposed interventions for testing strategy-proof voting. However, the JSON structure has critical blockers: all nodes and edges are missing required rationale fields (node_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale), all fields use null values instead of field omission for concept vs. intervention nodes, and the graph lacks two important concept nodes (Gibbard's data-type restriction, economic impact motivation) and several supporting edges. The proposed fixes address all blockers and enable proper merging across 500k data sources. After fixes, the graph will be valid and mergeable."
