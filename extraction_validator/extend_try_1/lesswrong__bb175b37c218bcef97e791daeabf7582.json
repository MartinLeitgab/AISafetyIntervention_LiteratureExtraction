However, critical schema violations exist: all edges lack required confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields, all nodes lack required node_rationale fields, intervention nodes lack lifecycle/maturity rationales, and one edge type is semantically incorrect ('mitigated_by' should be 'addressed_by'). The knowledge fabric is incomplete, missing important nodes for transfer failure evidence, spatial-reasoning hypothesis testing, and agentic capability implications. One intervention maturity rating is too high (should be 1, not 2, for the search augmentation since it is inferred not demonstrated). With proposed fixes applied, the extraction becomes valid, complete, and appropriately mergeable for downstream analysis."

      "EDGE CONFIDENCE APPROPRIATE: Edges to 'GPT-4 failures' and 'GPT-4 strong performance in chess' correctly rated confidence 3 (systematic observation) - author conducted multiple controlled tests. Edges from validation to interventions correctly rated 1-2 (moderate inference required to propose interventions not explicitly stated).",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE CORRECT: Pre-deployment evaluation suite correctly Phase 4; search augmentation correctly Phase 1 (model design). Both rationales missing but lifecycle assignments sound.",
      "GRAPH CONNECTIVITY: After proposed fixes, all nodes connect to fabric via shared intermediate nodes. No orphaned nodes would remain."
