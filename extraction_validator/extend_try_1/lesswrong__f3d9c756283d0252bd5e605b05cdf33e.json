These are not formatting choices but mandatory per instructions. Beyond schema, the graph has substantive issues: backwards causality on the first edge (unaligned behavior not caused by complexity), miscategorization of 'hypothetical cooperative performance' as validation evidence when it is theoretical prediction with no empirical results, and missing prerequisite edges connecting interpretability research to interventions. The core knowledge fabric pathway is present and logically sound: risk → problem (complexity) → inspiration (evolution) → design (harm penalties) → implementation (virtual environment + monitoring + loss) → prediction (cooperation) → interventions. However, the graph requires substantial additions to meet schema compliance and complete causal reasoning chains."

      "BLOCKER: All nodes missing 'node_rationale' field required by schema. Instruction specifies 'node_rationale: why essential to fabric with closest preceding data source section title reference'. Must add to all 11 nodes.",
      "BLOCKER: All 12 edges missing 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields. Instruction specifies both fields required. Confidence scores (mostly 1-2) require detailed justification for why inference was necessary.",
      "BLOCKER: Intervention nodes missing 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' fields. Node 9 (fine-tuning intervention) lacks rationale for lifecycle=3 (fine-tuning/RL) and maturity=1 (foundational). Node 10 (interpretability research) lacks rationale for lifecycle=1 and maturity=2.",
      "MAJOR: Edge 0 uses backwards causality. 'caused_by' type connects unaligned behavior TO complexity, but source says complexity prevents solving unalignment. Should be: complexity 'prevents effective treatment of' OR 'motivates search for alternative to' the risk. Confidence 2 indicates weak support; edge should be removed or reversed.",
      "MAJOR: Node 'Hypothetical cooperative performance in simulation' miscategorized as 'validation evidence'. Source provides zero empirical results, only conditional language: 'you might have'. This is theoretical prediction. Per instructions: validation evidence requires 'measurement and result', not hypothetical outcomes. Should be concept_category='theoretical insight'.",
      "MAJOR: Missing edge from 'Develop interpretability methods' intervention to 'Fine-tune advanced models' intervention showing prerequisite relationship. Source explicitly states interpretability is prerequisite: 'with the research in interpretability, you know what their utility function is' THEN 'every time the model does something that harms... it gets a loss'. This causal chain is broken.",
      "MAJOR: Node name 'Evolutionary selection yields cooperation from simple mechanisms' is too abstract per granularity rules. Should include 'multi-agent' and 'competitive pressure' to avoid ambiguous merging across 500k sources. Suggested: 'Evolutionary selection of cooperation via competitive advantage in multi-agent populations'.",
      "COVERAGE ANALYSIS: All 7 major claim pathways from DATA_SOURCE are extracted. Two additional missing edges identified: (1) prerequisite relationship between interpretability development and training intervention, (2) explicit connection showing smart model must discover utility functions (section: 'The smarter model will likely need to find a way to figure out the utility functions').",
      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: JSON structure is valid with proper nesting, but missing 3 categories of required fields on nodes (node_rationale), 2 categories on edges (edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale), and 2 categories on interventions (the _rationale fields for lifecycle and maturity). These are not optional per instructions.",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE JUSTIFICATION: Confidence scores are appropriate (mostly 1-2) given that data source is speculative philosophical proposal with zero empirical validation. All confidence=2 edges should note 'light inference applied per instructions' in rationale. Confidence=1 edges need stronger specification of speculative reasoning.",
      "DUPLICATE CHECK: 'Penalty loss when smart model reduces dumb agents' utility' and 'Interpretability-derived utility monitoring' appear different: former is the loss signal mechanism, latter is the prerequisite monitoring system. Not duplicates - they work together (monitoring → penalty calculation). Both necessary.",
      "ORPHAN CHECK: All nodes have at least one edge. No isolated nodes.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All 24 node references in edges (source/target pairs) exactly match node names. No broken references."
