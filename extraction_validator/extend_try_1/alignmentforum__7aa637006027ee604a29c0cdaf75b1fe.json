    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates solid structural understanding of the causal reasoning in the source material but suffers from critical schema compliance failures. All nodes lack required node_rationale attributes, all edges lack required edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale attributes, and two intervention nodes lack intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale. Additionally, the extraction is incomplete: four significant concept nodes are missing that are explicitly discussed in the source (in-distribution mask of out-of-distribution failures, generative vs runtime deliberation distinction, linguistic conflation, and associated edges). These missing nodes are essential to the knowledge fabric as they explain causal mechanisms explicitly stated in the text and footnotes. Intervention assignments appear reasonable but require stronger justification given the theoretical nature of the source material. With the proposed 21 fixes applied (4 nodes added, 15 field updates to add required rationales, 4 new edges), the graph would achieve schema compliance and substantially improved completeness."

      "BLOCKER ISSUE 1: Missing node_rationale on ALL nodes (0/8 present). This prevents downstream fabric integration and merging across 500k sources. Each node must include rationale with closest preceding section title per instructions.",
      "BLOCKER ISSUE 2: Missing edge attributes on ALL edges (0/9 have edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale). This violates schema requirements and prevents downstream analysis of evidence strength and reasoning justification.",
      "BLOCKER ISSUE 3: Missing intervention attributes on intervention nodes (0/2 have intervention_lifecycle_rationale, 0/2 have intervention_maturity_rationale). Schema explicitly requires these for interventions.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 1: In-distribution success masking out-of-distribution failure is critical causal explanation in text ('sufficiently usefully predictive to get by, so these poor abstractions are insufficiently challenged') and footnote 4, but not extracted as node. This is a problem analysis node that explains WHY conflation persists.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 2: Generative process deliberation vs runtime deliberation is explicitly discussed in footnote 4 as key mechanism ('process which generated the actor provides enough deliberation...bake them into reflexes'). This is essential problem analysis and design rationale foundation but not extracted.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 3: Linguistic/terminology dimension of conflation is explicitly identified (footnote 6: 'agent' as 'perfect exemplary linguistic victim' and main text: 'language we use to communicate...is prone to conflation') but only partially addressed. Not extracted as distinct problem analysis node.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 4: Expertise silo problem ('talk mainly to other domain experts about them') motivates the educational intervention but is not explicitly extracted as separate node explaining why interdisciplinary communication is needed.",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE CONCERN: 'Adopt granular goal-directedness taxonomy in AI risk assessment processes' assigned lifecycle 4 (Pre-Deployment Testing) with no evidence source supports this deployment phase. Data source is theoretical framework work. Should be lifecycle 1.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY CONCERN: Both interventions assigned maturity 2 with no validation evidence presented. Data source contains only conceptual development and menagerie contemplation, which supports maturity 1 (Foundational/Theoretical). Maturity 2 requires experimental proof-of-concept.",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION: Current edges use confidence 3 and 2 appropriately (systematic qualitative evidence and limited examples respectively), consistent with data source providing framework development and conceptual examples rather than empirical validation.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All 9 edges reference existing nodes correctly - no broken references detected.",
      "ORPHAN STATUS: No isolated nodes after proposed additions - all 12 final nodes connect via edges to overall fabric.",
      "FRAMEWORK DECOMPOSITION: The taxonomy is properly decomposed as implementation mechanism rather than black-box 'framework node', following instruction guidelines. However, additional conceptual nodes needed to show complete reasoning pathways.",
      "EVIDENCE MAPPING: Node rationales can be concisely mapped to source sections: opening paragraphs (risk), main text para 2 (conflation problem), footnote 4 (generation-runtime distinction), main text para 3-4 (design rationale), image caption + text (implementation), diverse menagerie discussion (validation), footnotes 5-6 (communication gaps)."
