    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures core concepts and reasonable interventions from the source material on correlated coverage in AI alignment, with correct referential integrity and no orphaned nodes. However, the extraction suffers from critical missing schema fields (node_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale, intervention lifecycle/maturity justifications) required by the prompt's final output format specifications. Additionally, several important causal-interventional pathways are missing: the direct link between patch resistance and correlated coverage solutions, the comparison between low-impact and value-decrementation principles, connections to Humean degrees of freedom as the mechanism for uncorrelated coverage, and the distribution-shift problem causing later problems to access unconstrained dimensions. The intervention lifecycle and maturity assignments are partially incorrect (low-impact should span phases 2-4, DWIM should include architectural design phase 1, and deployment DWIM should include training phases 1-3). These are correctable issues that preserve the fundamental graph structure while substantially improving alignment to source evidence and schema compliance."

      "BLOCKER: Schema requires 'node_rationale', 'edge_confidence_rationale', 'edge_rationale' fields on ALL nodes and edges per final_output_format specifications. Source provides extensive justification but extraction template did not populate these required fields. This violates mandatory schema compliance despite content being well-sourced.",
      "BLOCKER: Intervention nodes missing 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' fields explicitly required in schema. Without these, downstream safety researchers cannot evaluate intervention viability or phase-appropriateness.",
      "MAJOR: Missing critical edge from 'Patch resistant value misalignment' to 'Correlated coverage principle' - source explicitly states this relationship: 'From the standpoint of patch resistance concept, understanding correlated coverage... is what leads to traversing the gradient' (Section: Gradient of solutions). This edge is essential to knowledge fabric integration.",
      "MAJOR: Missing edge connecting 'Uncorrelated coverage' to new concept node 'Later problems drawn from different distribution' - source states: 'later problems are not drawn from the same barrel as prior problems' and '[a] 13th degree of freedom that isn't shadowed in the 1000 issues'. This is the causal mechanism enabling uncorrelated coverage.",
      "MAJOR: Intervention lifecycle assignments incorrect: (1) Low-impact should be 2,3,4 (pre-training architecture → fine-tuning objective → pre-deployment testing), not just 3; source discusses 'passing on by training or specification... generalizes across sharp capability gains'; (2) DWIM and Anapartistic should include lifecycle 1 (model design phase requirements); (3) No intervention should have lifecycle only at 5 without preceding phases for architectural/training setup.",
      "MAJOR: Missing nodes for Frankena's list comparison, Humean degree-of-freedom mechanism, and distribution-shift problem - these are distinct concept nodes appearing in the knowledge path from risk to interventions but not extracted. Source discusses: 'All terms in Frankena's list of desiderata have their own Humean freedom' and 'later problems not drawn from same barrel'.",
      "MAJOR: Missing comparison edge between low-impact and value-decrementation approaches - source explicitly justifies low-impact selection: 'reason to work on low-impact is... there's a core idea for it in a way there isn't for Try not to do anything that decreases value'. This comparative analysis is essential design rationale.",
      "MEDIUM: Edge confidence from 'Correlated coverage' to 'Human epistemology example' marked as 2 should be 3 (Medium evidence) - source provides systematic reasoning about human epistemic generalization as evidence for correlated coverage principle, not speculative connection.",
      "MEDIUM: Intervention maturity levels may be too aggressive - three interventions marked as maturity 1 with source only providing theoretical hopes and 'maybe' conditional arguments. Source: 'The hope that anapartistic reasoning could be...' and 'Maybe there's a core central idea' suggest maturity 1 (Foundational/Theoretical) is correct but rationales must be explicit.",
      "MINOR: All nodes and edges contain null 'embedding' field not in schema specifications - should be removed.",
      "CONSISTENCY: Node names follow granularity guidelines appropriately (e.g., 'Low-impact penalty objective in AI utility function' includes context and specificity). Aliases are reasonable 2-3 alternatives. Merging across 500k sources would be facilitated by this naming approach.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All 16 edges properly reference existing nodes - zero orphans, no dangling references. Graph structure is connected and acyclic for concept nodes with interventions as proper terminal nodes.",
      "VALIDATION EVIDENCE PATTERN: Three intervention nodes correctly end with validation evidence nodes flowing through motivates edges - path structure follows required pattern. However, validation evidence nodes lack supporting source section references in rationales.",
      "CRITICAL INFERENCE GAPS: Source discusses value specification complexity (Frankena's list, Humean freedom) as mechanism but extraction does not decompose this into extractable concept nodes as required by 'decomposition of frameworks' instruction. Humean degrees of freedom should be its own problem_analysis node.",
      "CRITICAL INFERENCE GAPS: Source distinguishes low-impact vs value-decrementation as design choice ('reason to work on low-impact is that...') but this comparative design rationale is not represented as node or edge despite being central to why low-impact approach was selected over alternatives."
