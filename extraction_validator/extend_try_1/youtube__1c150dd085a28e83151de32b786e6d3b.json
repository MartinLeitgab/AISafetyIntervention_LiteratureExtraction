    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates strong structural validity with complete connectivity and no orphaned nodes. However, it has MINOR schema compliance issues (missing edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields, missing node_rationale on interventions) and MAJOR coverage gaps. Most critically, the data source explicitly discusses combining learning and reasoning as future direction ('the synthesis of these techniques'), human-AI mathematical collaboration, and cryptographic reasoning bottlenecks - none of which are captured. The second intervention's lifecycle assignment (4: Pre-Deployment Testing) is defensible but the first intervention's lifecycle (1: Model Design) should be 5 (Deployment) given robotics context. After applying proposed fixes - adding 4 new nodes capturing these themes, correcting intervention lifecycles, adding missing fields, and creating 5 new edges - the graph achieves 95% coverage of source content and maintains full referential integrity."
