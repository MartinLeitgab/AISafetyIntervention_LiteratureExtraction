However, it lacks required fields (node_rationale on all nodes and edge_rationale on all edges) per schema specifications, and misses several important validation evidence nodes and edges that are explicitly present in the DATA_SOURCE (physical conservation laws, photon persistence example, and decision-theoretic implications). The risk node framing is somewhat inverted - DATA_SOURCE addresses both over- and under-application of Occam's Razor, not just one direction. The extraction correctly identifies the core theoretical contribution (implied vs additional invisibles distinction) and the two inferred interventions are plausible but appropriately marked as foundational/theoretical maturity. With the proposed field additions and node insertions applied, the graph would achieve complete schema compliance, proper DATA_SOURCE traceability, and capture all major causal-interventional pathways."

      "Missing schema fields: DATA_SOURCE requires node_rationale and edge_rationale fields throughout per instructions. All 12 nodes and all 13 edges lack these required fields. All intervention nodes (2 nodes) lack intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale.",
      "Coverage analysis: The graph captures 7 of 8 expected major causal pathways. Missing explicit pathways: (1) Physical conservation laws as validation evidence - DATA_SOURCE section 'It would violate Conservation of Energy' presents this but no validation evidence node references it. (2) Photon case example - used implicitly but no dedicated validation evidence node. (3) Practical decision implications - DATA_SOURCE Added section emphasizes real consequences but no implementation mechanism node captures this.",
      "Risk node framing: Original 'Faulty reasoning about invisible entities in AI systems' unidirectionally frames the risk. DATA_SOURCE actually warns against both: over-applying Occam's (rejecting large-entity models) AND under-applying it (accepting unfounded invisibles). Should be 'Incorrect application of Occam's Razor or Bayesian priors in reasoning about unobservable entities'.",
      "Intervention inference appropriateness: Both interventions inferred from philosophical principles with no explicit AI deployment guidance in DATA_SOURCE. Correctly marked as maturity 1-2 (foundational/theoretical). This inference is moderate per instructions and within scope for AI safety analysis.",
      "Artifact issues: Nodes and edges contain 'embedding' field set to null which is not in required schema. This is removable. Intervention maturity marks (1-2) are appropriate given purely theoretical source material.",
      "Connectivity verification: 12 nodes participate in 13 directed edges. All nodes have at least one incoming or outgoing edge. No cycles detected among edges. Risk node has 2 outgoing edges; both concept nodes at end of paths flow into intervention nodes (2 interventions total). Path completeness: risk → problem analysis → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → validation evidence → intervention structure followed for both intervention paths."
