Concept nodes lack node_rationale attributes. Intervention nodes lack lifecycle and maturity rationale fields. Several key causal pathways from the source text are missing, including the role of alignment/deployment as insufficient conditions, geographic concentration of AI development, timeline urgency factors, and labor market disruption mechanisms. The causal flow contains logical reversals (validation evidence flowing FROM rather than TO mechanisms). The merge of 'adaptation gap' concepts with theoretical insight obscures the problem-solution distinction. With the proposed fixes applied (adding missing fields, correcting edge directions, adding 8 missing concept nodes and 1 missing intervention node, merging 1 duplicate node pair, and adjusting intervention lifecycle/maturity values), the graph would achieve schema compliance, referential integrity, and substantially improved coverage of source content. The core reasoning fabric is sound but incompletely articulated."

      "MAJOR: Missing coverage of geographic concentration mechanism - author emphasizes 'least proximate to benefits' for non-Western populations but no explicit node captures this structural advantage in wealthy nations.",
      "MAJOR: Missing coverage of aggravating factors in 'Some Other Relevant Factors' section - early timeline, hard takeoff, wide uncanny canyon, and misalignment scenarios all strengthen adaptation case but absent from graph.",
      "MAJOR: Missing explicit edge showing alignment/deployment insufficiency - section 'Alignment, Deployment, Adaptation' argues these are necessary but not sufficient, but no edge captures this premise.",
      "MAJOR: Labor market disruption mechanism conflated with general 'rapid economic disruption' - author's illustration specifically mentions employment/wage effects but this distinct causal pathway not extracted.",
      "MINOR: 'Delay in equitable distribution' and 'Inevitability of adaptation gap' represent same phenomenon at different abstraction levels; should merge per knowledge fabric requirements to avoid duplicate nodes.",
