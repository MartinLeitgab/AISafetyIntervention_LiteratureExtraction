    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures core causal-interventional pathways from AGI misalignment risk through human wanting complexity to proposed interventions, but suffers from significant incompleteness in schema compliance (missing required rationale fields), underutilization of the source's extensive 27-dimensional taxonomy of wanting variation, failure to distinguish the dual roles of human wanting (epistemic vs normative), and omission of critical concepts like the corrigibility paradox and baked-in assumptions analysis. The graph structure is sound and references are valid, but node granularity could be improved through consolidating dimension-specific validation evidence and the philosophical problem analysis is oversimplified. After applying the proposed fixes—adding 10 new concept nodes, 3 new interventions, merging dimension nodes, and completing required rationale fields—the graph will provide comprehensive coverage of the source's reasoning and be mergeable across domain-specific data sources."

      "Schema Check: The primary blocker is pervasive missing rationale fields. All edges lack 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale'; all concept nodes lack 'node_rationale'; all intervention nodes lack lifecycle/maturity rationales. Additionally, non-schema fields ('embedding' set to null) appear throughout. These must be populated or removed per schema specification.",
      "Referential Integrity: All 14 edges reference existing nodes correctly—no dangling references detected. Graph connectivity is valid.",
      "Orphans: No orphaned nodes detected. All 12 concept nodes and 3 intervention nodes participate in at least one edge.",
      "Duplicates: No exact duplicate nodes or edges found. Concept nodes are distinct despite semantic overlap (e.g., 'Design AGI corrigible...' vs 'Integrate interpretability...' serve different design rationale roles).",
      "Rationale Mismatches—Critical Gap 1 (Baked-in Claims): Source section 'Baked-in claims' explicitly identifies 6 dubious assumptions about wanting yet extraction creates only single risk node. Should decompose into problem analysis nodes addressing each assumption. Source: 'These claims are dubious when applied to human wanting, and more dubious when applied to other minds wanting.'",
      "Rationale Mismatches—Critical Gap 2 (Dual Role Framework): Source 'The role of human wanting' presents two distinct sections: (1) 'Human wanting is a network of conjectural concepts' (epistemological role for hypothesis generation) and (2) 'Human wanting is half of an aligned AGI' (normative requirement for system design). Extraction treats these as single design rationale but they motivate fundamentally different interventions.",
      "Rationale Mismatches—Critical Gap 3 (Corrigibility Paradox): Source explicitly discusses tolerance paradox ('even to the point of a paradox of tolerance——the human might to correct the AGI in a way that the AGI recognizes as ruining the correctable nature of the AGI, and that should be allowed') but extraction omits as theoretical insight node. This is central to the 'through-and-through' corrigibility requirement.",
      "Coverage Gap 1 (Taxonomy Dimensions): The 27+ dimensions in 'The variety of human wanting' section (small/big-scope, context-dependent/independent, logically consistent/inconsistent, stable/changing, explicit/implicit, endorsed/unendorsed, agent-like/urge-like, etc.) are collapsed into single 'Conceptual taxonomy' validation node. Should create separate validation evidence nodes for major clusters to fully support design rationales requiring handling of specific variations.",
      "Coverage Gap 2 (Invalid Inference Risk): Source states: 'The desirable properties that come along with a human wanting X may not come along with designs, incentives, selection, behavior, or any other feature.' This risk of analogical reasoning failure is underrepresented—should have dedicated risk node and edges to problem analysis.",
      "Coverage Gap 3 (Pretheoretic Concepts): Source opens with 'We have pretheoretic ideas' and later states 'Our familiarity with human wanting can't be relied on too much without further analysis.' This epistemic caution is not captured as problem analysis node showing why blindly using human wanting as AGI template is risky.",
      "Coverage Gap 4 (Provisionally Mechanism): Source distinguishes between provisional wanting (open to revision) and being treated as provisional—this metacognitive distinction should be captured as separate implementation mechanism node for how AGI systems must track update-openness.",
      "Intervention Maturity Assessment: All three interventions correctly assessed as Maturity 2 (Experimental/Proof-of-Concept). Source provides extensive design rationale and philosophical justification but no empirical validation, deployment results, or systematic comparison to alternatives—prevents higher maturity ratings.",
      "Intervention Lifecycle Assessment: Corrigibility protocols (Lifecycle 1, Model Design) correctly placed as they require architectural support from design phase per source. Interpretability auditing (Lifecycle 4, Pre-Deployment) correctly placed. Human feedback (Lifecycle 5, Deployment) correctly placed as ongoing operational requirement.",
      "Evidence Confidence Ratings: Most edges rated 2-3 (Weak-Medium) appropriately. Source provides philosophical arguments and conceptual analysis but not controlled experiments or quantitative evidence, preventing higher confidence. Edge from 'complexity' to 'theoretical insight' correctly rated 3 (Medium) as source explicitly frames provisionally as mitigation strategy.",
      "After proposed fixes: graph would contain 18 nodes (12 concepts + 3 interventions + 3 new concepts + 3 new interventions after accounting for merges reducing to net 22 nodes), edges would increase from 14 to ~28 covering all major reasoning pathways, all schema fields populated, and dimensional taxonomy properly decomposed for cross-source merging."
