The graph successfully traces main reasoning paths and would merge well with similar sources, but loses ~20% of the source's conceptual completeness. All issues are fixable through node additions and minimal restructuring without changes to core fabric topology. JSON is structurally valid with full referential integrity."

      "COVERAGE GAP IDENTIFIED: Source text lists 13 distinct corrigibility principles (Unpersonhood, Taskishness, Mild optimization, Bounded utilities, Low impact, Myopia, Separate questioners, Conservatism, Conceptual legibility, Operator-looping, Whitelisting, Shutdownability, Behaviorism, Design-space anti-optimization, Domaining, Hard problem). Extracted graph only explicitly represents 7 nodes for these principles. Six principles (Myopia, Separate questioners, Shutdownability, Domaining, Behaviorism partially, Hard problem) are mentioned in source but not instantiated as design_rationale nodes. Per instruction 'If isolated nodes cannot be connected to the fabric...remove them', these should actually be included as placeholder nodes since they are part of the core reasoning framework, even if marked as 'left as an exercise'.",
      "DECOMPOSITION ISSUE: Operator-looping principle intentionally lists three implementation patterns: (1) 'shell out to operators for advice...execution in the rest of the tree is temporarily suspended', (2) 'E() is occasionally human spot-checked, either randomly with some small probability or at predetermined depths', (3) 'evaluation function contains a term which rates world states...higher, perhaps only probabilistically'. Current graph has one implementation_mechanism node for operator consultation but misses the other two distinct patterns. Per white-box reasoning requirements, these should be decomposed.",
      "FOUNDATIONAL ASSUMPTION MISSING: Data source explicitly establishes assumption of no inner alignment failure in component subsystems as prerequisite for entire analysis. Quote: 'I am assuming that there is no inner alignment failure of these component subsystems...if it does not hold, the corrigibility properties I introduce...will probably also not hold.' This assumption node is missing from extracted fabric but should exist as theoretical_insight connecting risk to problem_analysis.",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION: Edges from 'Theoretical analysis of corrigibility tax...' to implementation mechanisms rated confidence=2 (weak) appear under-rated. Source provides explicit systematic derivations for each principle-to-implementation mapping (e.g., 'we can try to ensure the system is a mild optimizer by (a) enforcing that the evaluation function provably has certain properties and (b) quantilizing the decision'). These should be confidence=3 (medium, systematic qualitative evidence).",
      "NODE GRANULARITY VERIFICATION: Node names follow prescribed patterns correctly. Example: 'Emergent harmful behavior from composable steering system in real-world domain' (concept with context) allows merging with similar sources. 'Quantilized action selection over diverse high-scoring world states' (implementation with mechanism detail) supports downstream effectiveness analysis. All verified against exemplar patterns provided in schema requirements.",
      "FABRIC CONNECTIVITY VERIFICATION: All current nodes (21 total) connect to main fabric. No orphaned nodes detected. Verification: traced paths from all three risk nodes through problem_analysis, theoretical_insight, design_rationale, implementation_mechanism, validation_evidence layers to intervention nodes. Longest path: risk→problem_analysis→theoretical_insight→design_rationale→implementation_mechanism→validation_evidence→intervention (7 node types).",
      "FRAMEWORK DECOMPOSITION VERIFICATION: Source introduces corrigibility framework from external source (Eliezer's glowfic) but does not present as black-box. Instead, systematically applies each principle separately with dedicated section 'Applying each principle to the system'. Extraction correctly decomposes into component nodes (e.g., mild optimization, impact regularization, operator-looping) rather than single 'corrigibility' node. ✓ Complies with white-box requirement.",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE ASSESSMENT: Lifecycle assignments verified against source context. Interventions marked lifecycle=1 (Model Design) include 'Design steering systems with bounded evaluation' (early architectural choice). Lifecycle=3 (Fine-Tuning/RL) for 'Embed operator consultation policies' (requires training adjustments). Lifecycle=4 (Pre-Deployment Testing) for guard mechanisms (validation phase). Lifecycle=5 (Deployment) for organizational policy 'Limit operational tasks' (runtime constraint). All justified by 'Applying each principle' implementation sections.",
      "MATURITY ASSESSMENT: All intervention nodes rated maturity=1-2 as appropriate given source status. Maturity=1 (Foundational/Theoretical) for 'Design steering systems...' and 'Apply domain whitelist...' since source provides conceptual descriptions without implementation code. Maturity=2 (Experimental/PoC) for guard mechanisms since source provides detailed pseudo-code specifications and design patterns. None rated maturity=3+ (Prototype/Pilot) because source does not report empirical testing results. This conservatism reflects source's own position: 'I didn't spend a ton of time thinking about how to apply each principle...It may be that some of my ideas don't work'.",
      "SOURCE-EXTRACTION CONSISTENCY CHECK: Verified all major quotes from DATA_SOURCE appear as concept node descriptions or edge rationales. Examples: (1) tree-search definition 'Perform tree search over world states' → node description, (2) corrigibility tax claim 'effectiveness penalty...alignment tax' → validation_evidence node, (3) quantilization mechanism 'find multiple sufficiently-diverse candidate world states, and then...choose randomly' → implementation_mechanism node. ✓ Traceability established.",
      "MISSING EVIDENCE: One significant gap—source discusses how 'aligned foundation models don't imply aligned systems' but this meta-safety insight is not explicitly captured. The concept appears implicitly in 'Capability amplification via composition' problem_analysis node but lacks dedicated node. Impact: moderate (conceptually captured but not explicitly traceable). Could add theoretical_insight node 'Compositionality breaks alignment properties of components' if extraction needed absolute completeness.",
      "INSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE SUMMARY: (1) Causal-interventional pathways: ✓ Captured 5 main paths from risks through all 6 concept categories to interventions. (2) Distinct claims extraction: ✓ ~16 concept nodes + 6 intervention nodes = 22 nodes (target ~15 per 5000 words achieved). (3) Naming consistency: ✓ All names follow granular patterns enabling cross-source merging. (4) Traceability: ✓ All nodes reference source section titles. (5) Isolation check: ✗ Minor—6 principles marked 'left as exercise' are mentioned but not fully represented."
