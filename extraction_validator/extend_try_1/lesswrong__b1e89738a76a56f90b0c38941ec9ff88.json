    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates strong conceptual coherence and accurately captures the primary causal-interventional pathway from outer alignment risks through game-theoretic analysis to proposed interventions. However, the JSON structure has multiple BLOCKER-level schema violations: missing required fields (edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale, node_rationale on all nodes and edges) and extraneous 'embedding' fields. Referential integrity is sound - all edges correctly reference existing nodes. The extraction is incomplete relative to the source: it misses cognitive science methods explicitly listed by the author, the multi-scale scope of alignment failures, the PhD program-seeking intervention, and the author's enabling background. Coverage of the primary alignment-failure pathway is good, but secondary contextual elements and the author's personal research trajectory are underrepresented. With the proposed 4 new nodes (cognitive science, multi-scale failures, PhD program-seeking, methodological synthesis), 4 new edges, complete addition of all missing rationale fields, removal of 'embedding' attributes, and enriched descriptions grounding abstract concepts in source evidence, the graph will achieve full schema compliance, increased coverage, and improved mergeability with similar PhD/dissertation-oriented sources in the 500k corpus."

      "SCHEMA BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: All 9 nodes missing 'node_rationale' field explicitly required by final_output_format specification: 'node_rationale: why essential to fabric with closest preceding data source section title reference'",
      "SCHEMA BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: All 8 edges missing 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields explicitly required by final_output_format specification",
      "SCHEMA BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: All nodes and edges contain 'embedding' field set to null - not in required schema, should be removed",
      "SCHEMA MAJOR ISSUE: Intervention nodes [7] and [8] missing 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' despite having lifecycle/maturity values",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All 8 edges correctly reference 9 defined nodes - no orphaned references detected",
      "NO ORPHANED NODES: Each node is referenced by at least one edge; no isolated satellite nodes",
      "NO DUPLICATES: No duplicate nodes or edges detected",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Source explicitly states author learned 'The Selfish Gene and many of the posts by Scott Alexander drew me to learn more about game theory' and 'evolutionary psychology perspective... made sense of the associated failures in reasoning' - cognitive science / evolutionary psychology dimension absent from graph",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Source explicitly states 'I am interested in using computational game theory, cognitive science, system modeling, causal inference, and operations research methods' - cognitive science methods not represented as implementation mechanism",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Source states 'there are smaller scale systems where similar alignment issues exist' - multi-scale alignment failure scope not captured as distinct problem analysis node",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Source requests 'programs with professors who might be interested in taking on a student in this topic' - PhD program identification and advisor-seeking are actionable interventions not represented in graph",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Source provides extensive background (aerospace engineering, 8 years leadership, industrial engineering masters, technical studies) - enabling conditions and researcher qualifications not represented as implementation-enabling nodes",
      "EVIDENCE MATCHING: Risk node 'Unintended consequences from outer alignment failures in AI systems' well-grounded in source: 'The intersection between these systems and AI systems is now simultaneously fascinating and horrifying to me'",
      "EVIDENCE MATCHING: Problem analysis node 'Confusing the rule for the space' correctly linked to LessWrong essay reference in source with author's statement 'has long frustrated me, but now I'm starting to better understand why it occurs'",
      "EVIDENCE MATCHING: Theoretical insight node 'Game-theoretic modeling' accurately captures author's transformative experience: 'for perhaps the first time, game theory made them something I felt I could actually operationalize'",
      "EVIDENCE MATCHING: Design rationale and implementation mechanism nodes appropriately abstract author's stated dissertation goal but lack specific grounding to source quotes in node descriptions",
      "INFERENCE ASSESSMENT: Edge from 'System-level simulations' to 'Social media misalignment evidence' marked confidence 2, appropriate because author references The Social Dilemma as motivation but does not present experimental validation of simulation methodology",
      "INFERENCE ASSESSMENT: All edges marked confidence 2 or higher - no speculative (confidence 1) edges present despite instruction that moderate inference edges should be confidence 1; this may indicate under-inference or appropriately high confidence in reasoning paths",
      "MATURITY ASSESSMENT: Both interventions assigned maturity 1 (Foundational/Theoretical) appropriate because author seeks PhD placement to develop research - interventions are at planning/proposal stage not execution",
      "LIFECYCLE ASSESSMENT: Intervention [7] (stress tests) assigned lifecycle 1 (Model Design) - appropriate for objective-specification phase; Intervention [8] (causal evaluation) assigned lifecycle 4 (Pre-Deployment Testing) - appropriate for pre-release evaluation phase",
      "MERGEABILITY CONCERN: Node 'Employing computational game theory to anticipate outer alignment failure modes in AI systems' is design rationale but description is generic - adding source-grounded detail ('leverage my interests, advances alignment research, is also achievable') would improve cross-source merging",
      "MERGEABILITY CONCERN: Implementation mechanism node describes general causal-inference-plus-OR approach but doesn't specify game-theoretic integration detail - would benefit from source quote: 'game theory made them something I felt I could actually operationalize'",
      "PATH STRUCTURE: Primary causal-interventional path correctly flows Risk → Problem Analysis [2 branches] → Theoretical Insight → Design Rationale → Implementation Mechanism → Validation Evidence → Interventions [2 branches], following template structure",
      "DISCONNECTION: Cognitive science methods mentioned in source but not connected to primary knowledge fabric - represents genuine extraction gap",
      "DISCONNECTION: Author's background and credentials mentioned but not integrated as enabling conditions for interventions - represents scope limitation not error",
      "SECTION TRACEABILITY: Edge rationales reference generic 'The Social Dilemma' and 'Dissertation Topic' but lack precise section title references per requirement 'closest preceding data source section title reference' - source lacks explicit section headings making traceability to paragraph-level analysis"
