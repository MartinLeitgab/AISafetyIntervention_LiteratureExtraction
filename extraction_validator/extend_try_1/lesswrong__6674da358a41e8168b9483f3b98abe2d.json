    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates correct overall structure with a complete causal-interventional pathway from risk through all six concept categories to intervention node. However, critical schema violations exist: missing required rationale fields (node_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale, edge_rationale) on multiple nodes and edges, and undocumented 'embedding' fields violate schema. Two significant missing nodes represent gaps in coverage: author's explicit uncertainty about research goal alignment and the critical design principle requiring software/community enforcement of factored cognition behaviors. The intervention maturity is correctly identified as 1 (Foundational/Theoretical) due to author's stated low confidence, but confidence level of key motivating edge should be reduced from 2 to 1 based on source evidence of uncertainty. Referential integrity is sound, and no orphaned nodes exist. With proposed fixes applied, the fabric would achieve schema compliance and improved coverage of source content."

Source Abstract: 'I'm not confident of this exploration being useful at all. But at least I wrote it down.' and Feasibility: 'The estimates are sloppy and probably overconfident.' This is explicit author uncertainty requiring lowest confidence.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: PASS - all 6 edges reference existing nodes with exact name matches. No dangling references detected.",
      "ORPHAN CHECK: PASS - all 7 nodes connect to fabric through edges. Node connection structure forms complete path risk→problem→insight→design→mechanism→validation→intervention with no isolated nodes.",
      "DUPLICATES: PASS - no duplicate nodes or edges detected. Node names are appropriately granular and non-overlapping.",
      "LIFECYCLE CLASSIFICATION: Intervention lifecycle=6 'Other' is defensible for foundational infrastructure initiative spanning multiple phases (design through deployment) over 5-15 months per source.",
      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: 'embedding' field present in extracted JSON but not part of SCHEMA_REQUIREMENTS. This violates schema definition and should be removed from all nodes/edges."
