    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the primary causal-interventional pathways from objective misspecification and shutdown resistance risks through CIRL and IRD interventions with appropriate intermediate concept nodes. However, the extraction significantly underrepresents the multi-agent alignment challenges, preference heterogeneity complexities, and inner alignment problem that constitute substantial portions of the DATA_SOURCE discussion. Critical coverage gaps include: (1) the gorilla problem as primary motivation for safety research, (2) convergent instrumental subgoals mechanism, (3) Gricean semantics for language interpretation, (4) hierarchical planning structures in preference learning, (5) experiencing vs. remembering self divergence, (6) meta-preference frameworks, (7) multi-agent antisocial behavior and Somalia problem, and (8) inner alignment as learning-specific risk. These absences represent 30-40% of DATA_SOURCE conceptual content. The current extraction achieves valid JSON structure with correct schema compliance after proposed field-level corrections and maintains referential integrity across the two primary intervention pathways. With the addition of 9 new concept nodes and 2 new intervention nodes to capture multi-agent and preference-learning complexities, plus maturity downgrades for three interventions lacking empirical validation, the graph would achieve substantially improved coverage while maintaining coherent fabric structure."

      "SCHEMA CHECK: All nodes and edges conform to required attributes. Minor issue: 'embedding' field appears in original JSON but is not in SCHEMA_REQUIREMENTS - recommend removal for consistency. All concept nodes properly specify concept_category without intervention lifecycle fields; all intervention nodes specify lifecycle (1-6) and maturity (1-4) without concept_category. Node aliases present for all nodes per requirements.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All 18 edges reference nodes that exist in node list. No broken references detected. Edge directionality follows causal-interventional flow from risk → concept nodes → intervention nodes per instructions.",
      "ORPHANS: Zero orphaned nodes detected. All 20 nodes connect to at least one edge; full fabric connectivity achieved across both primary pathways (CIRL pathway and IRD pathway).",
      "DUPLICATES: No duplicate nodes detected. 'Reward uncertainty in AI objective promotes corrigibility' and 'Agent certainty about reward encourages shut-down avoidance' represent complementary asymmetric concepts (solution vs. problem mechanism) in different pathways - no merge warranted.",
      "EVIDENCE COVERAGE: Extraction covers DATA_SOURCE sections: (1) 'Standard model assuming known objective in AI design' from HC book discussion of AI paradigm, (2) 'Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning' section with CIRL game formalization and Off-Switch Game analysis, (3) 'Inverse Reward Design' section with lava-avoidance validation. However, significant DATA_SOURCE sections are not represented: (4) 'gorilla problem' risk motivation, (5) 'convergent instrumental subgoals' mechanism, (6) Gricean semantics requirement for language, (7) hierarchical planning structures as preference-learning challenge, (8) experiencing self / remembering self divergence, (9) meta-preferences solution, (10) multi-agent preference aggregation, (11) Somalia utilitarian problem, (12) inner alignment as learning-specific risk, (13) robustness and transparency as safety complements.",
      "MATURITY ASSESSMENT: Three interventions require downgrade from claimed maturity 2: (1) CIRL training intervention - source provides framework only, no empirical training validation documented, (2) Shutdown mechanism integration - Off-Switch Game is theoretical analysis without implementation/experimental validation per DATA_SOURCE, (3) IRD deployment - lava test is pre-deployment simulation, not operational validation. SOURCE EVIDENCE: DATA_SOURCE states regarding IRD: 'They demonstrate that by using risk-averse planning with respect to this posterior distribution, the agent can avoid negative side effects' - describes simulation demonstration, not deployment.",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE CORRECTION: 'Deploy inverse reward design with Bayesian posterior and risk-averse planning when transferring agents to new environments' incorrectly assigned lifecycle 5 (Deployment). DATA_SOURCE presents lava-avoidance as validation evidence (lifecycle 4). Correction: lifecycle 5 should be reserved for operational deployment with real-world evidence; current source only provides pre-deployment testing via simulation.",
      "COVERAGE GAPS ANALYSIS: DATA_SOURCE devotes ~1200 words to multi-agent alignment challenges ('Overall, it's not obvious how we deal with the transition from a single human to multiple humans'), including differential benefit to selfish agents, law-evasion via specification gaming, and Somalia problem. Current extraction has zero nodes or edges addressing multi-agent settings - this represents 15-20% of DATA_SOURCE content. DATA_SOURCE discusses meta-preferences as potential solution to preference drift ('could potentially be solved by learning meta-preferences') - not captured in current extraction. DATA_SOURCE identifies Gricean semantics as required implementation mechanism for principle 3 ('We need to use Gricean semantics for language') - absent from extraction. DATA_SOURCE discusses inner alignment as learning-specific risk (referenced in Rohin's opinion section) - not represented.",
      "INFERENCE APPLICATION: Proposed interventions for meta-preferences and multi-agent alignment represent moderate inference (confidence level 1-2 required) because source identifies problems but does not explicitly propose interventions. Gricean pragmatics intervention represents light inference that source requirement ('use Gricean semantics') maps to training objective modification - justified by principle 3 operationalization discussion.",
      "EXTRACTION COMPLETENESS: Current 20 nodes and 18 edges adequately capture ~60-65% of core reasoning pathways from DATA_SOURCE. Two primary causal-interventional threads are well-represented: (A) objective misspecification → standard model → uncertainty → CIRL → training intervention, and (B) side effects → proxy reward uncertainty → IRD → pre-deployment testing. Multi-agent and preference-learning complexity threads are severely underrepresented, requiring 9-12 additional nodes to achieve comprehensive coverage per MANDATORY_SUCCESS_CRITERIA requirement for 'all causal-interventional paths from risks through all intermediate concept nodes to actionable interventions'."
