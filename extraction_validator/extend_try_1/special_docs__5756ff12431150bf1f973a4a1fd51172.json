    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates strong conceptual structure and complete path connectivity from risk through all intermediate concept categories to interventions. However, it contains critical BLOCKER-level schema violations: all nodes are missing the required 'node_rationale' field, all intervention nodes lack 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' fields, and all edges lack 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields per the specified output format. Additionally, the graph misses secondary causal branches present in the source regarding the compute-scaling vs. algorithmic advancement debate, which represents incomplete fabric coverage. The intervention node maturity level for 'Integrate Crafter' should be upgraded from 2 to 3 based on release status. JSON structure itself is valid and referentially sound, with no orphaned or duplicate nodes. After applying proposed fixes, the extraction would be valid, complete, and mergeable across domains."

DATA_SOURCE explicitly discusses compute scaling vs algorithmic advancement debate: 'One interesting debate about the future of AI has to do with the extent to which further progress will come from dramatic improvements to algorithms, or from the increased availability of compute resources...progress in RL has closely tracked increases in compute budgets (e.g. MuZero and EfficientZero)...Danijar sees some merit to this argument, he does think that there remain fundamental advances in algorithm design that we'll have to make before reaching human-level AI.'
