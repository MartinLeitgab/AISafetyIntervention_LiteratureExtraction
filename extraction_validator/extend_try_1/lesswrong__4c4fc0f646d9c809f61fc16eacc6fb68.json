Additionally, 6 important nodes from the source are missing: the inadequate equilibria theoretical insight (central to 'My Take' section), media sector size limitation evidence, RealPlayer technology-adoption-without-growth validation, real estate cartel case, housing systemic drag concept, and the discontinuous-takeoff theoretical conclusion. All nodes lack required rationale fields. After proposed fixes are applied (adding 6 nodes, removing 4 duplicate edges, adding all required fields), the knowledge fabric will properly connect the source's causal reasoning from empirical risk through policy bottleneck analysis to sector-specific interventions, with complete traceability to source sections."
