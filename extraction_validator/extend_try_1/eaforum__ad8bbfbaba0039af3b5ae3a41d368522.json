    "summary": "The extracted knowledge fabric is structurally sound with complete referential integrity after adding required fields. All nodes properly connect through intermediate concept categories to intervention nodes per specification. Primary issues are schema compliance: missing required 'node_rationale' fields on all nodes and missing 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields on all edges per output format specification. No blockers remain after adding these fields. All inference applications (taxonomy mechanism, grantmaking criteria integration) appropriately flagged with confidence levels 1-2. Extracted fabric matches source text evidence comprehensively, covering all major causal pathways from risk through problem analysis, theoretical insight, design rationale, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence to interventions. Minor edge cases: 'Survey on AI existential risk scenarios' node has lower direct evidentiary support due to being cited as external reference rather than detailed in source, but validation evidence node appropriately included given its role in source reasoning. Extraction achieves mandatory success criteria of connected knowledge fabric with all concept-to-intervention pathways intact and appropriate granularity for cross-source merging."

      "Schema compliance: Output format specification requires 'node_rationale' field on all nodes (6 concept node categories + intervention nodes) and 'edge_confidence_rationale', 'edge_rationale' on all edges. Current extraction missing these fields entirely but JSON structure otherwise valid.",
      "Referential integrity: All 14 nodes and 14 edges maintain proper references with no orphaned nodes. Feedback loop structure appropriate: edges flow from risk through concept categories to interventions without improper reverse flows from interventions.",
      "Causal-interventional pathways: Six core reasoning paths successfully extracted per specification template: (1) Risk→Problem Analysis→Problem Analysis→Theoretical Insight→Design Rationale→Implementation Mechanism→Implementation Mechanism→Validation Evidence→Intervention (four separate intervention branches); (2) Interconnections achieved through shared validation evidence nodes enabling multiple intervention pathways from common evidence.",
      "Inference application: Three interventions require inference flagging: (a) 'Mandate specificity taxonomy tagging' inferred from source's discussion of distinction importance but not explicitly proposed as publication policy—confidence 2 appropriate; (b) 'Update EA educational curricula' inferred from author's observation that specific arguments dominate 'default' EA content and author's desire to 'see this redressed'—confidence 2 appropriate for light inference; (c) 'Integrate argument specificity criteria into AI safety grantmaking' inferred from portfolio principle ('broader portfolio of work') applied speculatively to grantmaking governance—confidence 2 appropriate for moderate inference. All marked with maturity levels 1-2 reflecting theoretical/proof-of-concept status.",
      "Validation evidence support: Two validation evidence nodes included—'Survey on AI existential risk scenarios' (cited in Acknowledgments as work source engaged with) and 'Observed confusion and miscommunication' (qualitative evidence throughout source). Both appropriately support intermediate concept nodes and motivate multiple intervention branches.",
      "Granularity and mergeability: Node names follow preferred patterns: 'Taxonomy of argument specificity embedded in AI safety publications' (specific context), not overly atomic ('taxonomy', 'specificity') or overly coarse ('complex system for improving discourse'). Names facilitate standalone understanding and cross-source merging if identical concepts appear elsewhere.",
      "Source text coverage: Major claims successfully captured: (1) general vs specific argument distinction as key insight; (2) benefit to prioritization ('Why this distinction matters'); (3) observed imbalance in EA content toward specific arguments; (4) expert disagreement on threat models; (5) examples of argument specificity levels (Ngo, Carlsmith); (6) portfolio principle dependent on argument specificity. No significant source claims left unrepresented in fabric.",
      "Edge confidence calibration: Edges appropriately graded 1-5 based on evidence strength. Confidence-3 edges (medium) have 'systematic qualitative evidence' (e.g., direct author statements on problem-solution links). Confidence-2 edges (weak) reflect single examples, preliminary support, or light inference (e.g., taxonomy connection, grantmaking criteria). No confidence-1 edges required as most speculative connections still supported by directional evidence in source.",
      "Framework decomposition: Source does not present named frameworks requiring decomposition. Discussion of general vs specific arguments is conceptual distinction, not named framework like 'Constitutional AI'. White-box component extraction avoided false positive decomposition unnecessary for this source.",
      "Feedback loops: Appropriate circular structure between concept nodes avoided creating problematic cycles. No edges flow out of intervention nodes except to other interventions (none present). Problem analysis nodes appropriately include multiple instantiations (unclear specificity, wide disagreement, overemphasis) reflecting concept richness without over-granularity."
