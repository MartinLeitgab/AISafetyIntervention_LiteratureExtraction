However, BLOCKER issues exist: (1) Edge directions are semantically reversed between problem_analysis and theoretical_insight nodes - problem analysis nodes should be TARGETS of 'caused_by' edges FROM risks, not sources of edges to insights; (2) Missing 7 concept nodes representing key problem analyses and implementation details explicitly in source text (AI warning indicator uncertainty, organizational structure diversity, OSINT risks, government control risks, state defection risks, recruitment mechanisms, and government feasibility evidence); (3) Schema compliance issues with missing 'node_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields on all nodes/edges. The graph becomes valid and mergeable after: reversing 2 edge directions, adding 7 new concept nodes with proper edges, renaming 1 duplicate concept node, and populating all required rationale fields with section title references."

      "BLOCKER 1 - Edge direction error: Edges[0-1] show risks pointing TO problem_analysis with 'caused_by' type, which is semantically backwards. Per instructions, causal-interventional flow should be Risk → [causes/caused_by relationship] → Problem_analysis. Current implementation has source=problem node, target=risk node with type='caused_by', meaning 'problem caused_by risk' which is directionally correct, but edge lists show opposite. Requires verification of edge direction semantics.",
      "BLOCKER 2 - Edge semantics error: Edges[2-3] show Problem_analysis node as SOURCE with 'mitigated_by' pointing to Theoretical_insight. This violates instruction that 'ALL nodes building the rationale for a proposed intervention MUST flow into the intervention node'. The proper flow is Risk → Problem_analysis → [addressed_by/mitigated_by] → Theoretical_insight, making Problem_analysis the SOURCE and Insight the TARGET, but relationship should be 'addressed_by' not 'mitigated_by'.",
      "MAJOR ISSUE - Coverage gap on AI: Source explicitly states 'for AI, the story is less clean' and describes uncertainty about warning indicators. No node captures this important problem analysis. Added node 'Uncertainty about early indicators for pivotal AI moments' to reflect source section 'The story is less clean for AI, but potentially more important'.",
      "MAJOR ISSUE - Coverage gap on organizational structure: Source section 'How should a early warning forecasting center be structured?' dedicates substantial text to 'most people in forecasting center will not be judgmental forecasters' and lists 7+ support role categories. This implementation mechanism is not captured. Added node 'Multi-role organizational structure with specialist support staff'.",
      "MAJOR ISSUE - Coverage gap on risks to OSINT variant: Source Variant 1 states OSINT 'may be seen as legibly threatening to nation-state actors' creating negative reputational consequences. This risk is not modeled. Added node 'Reputational and operational risks from explicit civilian intelligence activity' with edge from OSINT intervention.",
      "MAJOR ISSUE - Coverage gap on government variant risks: Source Variant 3 explicitly lists downsides including 'less control over what questions' and 'relevant government may take unilateral actions that defect'. These problem analyses missing. Added nodes for 'Loss of EA epistemic autonomy' and 'Risk of unilateral state action'.",
      "MAJOR ISSUE - Coverage gap on government adoption barriers: Source states 'many people have tried to get gov'ts more interested in forecasting...with limited success' but also notes UK exception. This mixed evidence is not captured as validation evidence. Added node 'Limited historical success in improving government forecasting capability'.",
      "MAJOR ISSUE - Schema compliance: Instructions specify all nodes require 'node_rationale' field with 'closest preceding data source section title reference'. All extracted nodes missing this field. Same applies to edges missing 'edge_rationale' field per instructions.",
      "MODERATE ISSUE - Confidence calibration: Multiple edges marked confidence=2 when source provides explicit causal reasoning. Example: Edge between 'Short-range forecasting improvements' and 'Establish forecasting center' marked confidence=3, but source explicitly states this is the 'concrete means to realise those improvements' - should be 4 (strong).",
      "MODERATE ISSUE - Validation pathway clarity: Edges from validation_evidence nodes to implementation_mechanisms suggest these precedents validate specific mechanisms like 'cold/signal/hot teams', but source only validates that forecasting centers CAN work, not HOW they should be structured. Validation edges should point to design_rationale node (Establish forecasting center concept), not to mechanism nodes.",
      "MINOR ISSUE - Duplicate nodes with different types: 'Establish Early Warning Forecasting Center to convert diverse data...' (concept, design_rationale) and 'Establish EA Early Warning Forecasting Center as private organization' (intervention) describe same entity. Both should exist but relationship needs clarification - concept node should flow into intervention via 'implemented_by' edge.",
      "PROCESS NOTE - Inference strategy applied: Per instructions, moderate inference used for edges connecting validation evidence to design rationale (confidence marked 2-3). Light inference used to identify missing AI warning indicator problem and government risks problem (confidence would be 2). These inferences are well-supported by explicit source text but represent synthesis rather than direct statement.",
      "VERIFICATION EVIDENCE - Mandatory checklist item 1: Verified no direct risk→intervention edges exist. All edges respect intermediate concept nodes. ✓",
      "VERIFICATION EVIDENCE - Mandatory checklist item 2: After adding 7 new concept nodes, complete connectivity achieved through interconnected paths. ✓ after fixes.",
      "VERIFICATION EVIDENCE - Mandatory checklist item 3: No isolated nodes after fix. All nodes connected with minimum 1 incoming or outgoing edge. ✓ after fixes.",
      "VERIFICATION EVIDENCE - Mandatory checklist item 4: Framework decomposition - Early Warning Forecasting Center IS decomposed into component nodes (cold/signal/hot teams, data pipelines, alert protocols, etc). Not presented as monolithic black box. ✓",
      "SOURCE CITATION - Core mechanism evidence: Source states 'I propose the hypothetical example of a futuristic EA Early Warning Forecasting Center. The main intent is that...EAs can potentially (a) have several weeks of lead time to divert our efforts to respond rapidly to such crises and (b) target those efforts effectively.' This validates lead_time as central causal mechanism."
