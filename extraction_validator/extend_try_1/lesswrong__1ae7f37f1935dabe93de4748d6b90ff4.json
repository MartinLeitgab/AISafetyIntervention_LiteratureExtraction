The extraction demonstrates moderate understanding of the knowledge fabric but violates schema requirements on 4 of 5 mandatory fields and misses 3-4 major conceptual edges from source reasoning. With application of proposed fixes (adding 6 new nodes, 6 new edges, and completing all 20+ missing field values), the extraction would become valid, mergeable, and cover ~85% of the source's reasoning pathways. The core issue is incomplete execution of field-population requirements, not conceptual misunderstanding."

These are BLOCKER-level violations.",
      "COMPLETENESS: Source explicitly rejects further-fact view ('I take the further-fact view to be wrong') but no node captures this theoretical rejection. Source develops welfare measurement ambiguity through painting analogy but no problem-analysis node exists for it. Source warns that all value becomes preference-dependent with no intrinsic goods, but this limitation is not extracted as validation evidence.",
      "EDGE COVERAGE: Missing causal edge from rejection of further-fact view to pragmatic clustering (logical prerequisite). Missing problem-analysis edge from incomparability to welfare measurement ambiguity (source develops this distinction). Missing validation edges showing how connectedness grounds the algorithm and how the scheme recovers moderate weighting. Missing problem edge about arbitrary value assignment.",
      "INFERENCE APPROPRIATENESS: Intervention nodes require moderate inference (source does not propose concrete AI interventions), correctly marked as Lifecycle 1-3 and Maturity 1-2, but inference chain not documented in rationales. Source states '[Epistemic status: sloppy thoughts not informed by the literature]' supporting low maturity assignments.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All edges reference existing nodes (✓). No orphaned nodes (✓). No duplicate nodes (✓).",
      "CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION: Source distinguishes four options for reconciling person-affecting views with fuzzy identity (paragraph 'If the further-fact view is wrong...' with 1-4 enumerated options) but extraction captures only options 3-4, missing options 1-2 as distinct design-rationale branches.",
      "EVIDENCE QUALITY: Edge confidence scores of 2-3 conflict with source's limited empirical basis. Source is philosophical exploration ('sloppy thoughts not informed by literature') - all edges should be confidence 1-2, most properly confidence 1."
