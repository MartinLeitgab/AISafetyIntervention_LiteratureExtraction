However, the extraction is significantly incomplete and contains four BLOCKER-level schema violations (missing required node_rationale fields on all nodes; missing edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale on all edges; invalid intervention_lifecycle and unsupported intervention_maturity assignments) and three MAJOR content issues (understated risk node claim, overstated theoretical insight claim, and underjustified maturity classification). More critically, the fabric captures only 1 of 5 explicitly stated project purposes, missing four major validation evidence nodes and their motivating edges that connect to intervention justification. The extraction requires substantial additions (4 new validation evidence nodes, multiple new edges) to achieve mandatory coverage of all causal pathways from risks through outcomes to interventions. After proposed fixes are applied, the graph would be valid and mergeable across sources."

      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE POST-FIX: After applying proposed changes, all required fields present, all intervention nodes have lifecycle 1-6 and maturity 1-4, all concept nodes have concept_category, no category type mixing, all referenced nodes exist, all edges have 1-5 confidence scores. JSON structure valid and schema-compliant.",
      "CROSS-SOURCE MERGEABILITY: Node names follow granularity guidelines after proposed fixes: 'Iterative workshop-based vignette writing and feedback cycle' (good specificity for merging); 'Systematic coverage of plausible AI futures reduces forecasting bias' (specific outcome, mergeable); 'Reusable vignette collection for AI safety community reference' (specific artifact, mergeable across sources). Names avoid both over-atomization ('workshops', 'feedback') and over-coarseness ('AI project'). Aliases (2-3 per node) enable synonym matching across 500k sources.",
      "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - CHECK 1: No direct risk→intervention edges exist. All edges flow through intermediate concept nodes. PASS.",
      "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - CHECK 2: All pathways interconnected; no isolated reasoning paths. After fixes adding 4 new validation evidence nodes and 4 new edges, all pathways connect through shared intervention node. PASS post-fix.",
      "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - CHECK 3: Each node has ≥1 edge reference; no isolated/duplicate nodes. Current extraction has all 7 nodes connected. Proposed additions also connect. PASS post-fix.",
      "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - CHECK 4: Framework decomposition check N/A - no new frameworks introduced only methodology project description.",
      "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - CHECK 5: Node name granularity valid after fixes per templates: 'Concrete AI scenario vignettes enable validation' (correct level vs. atomic 'vignettes' or coarse 'vignette project'); 'Iterative workshop cycle' (correct vs. atomic 'feedback' or coarse 'research methodology'). PASS post-fix."
