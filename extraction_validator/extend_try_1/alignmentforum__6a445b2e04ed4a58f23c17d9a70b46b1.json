    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates strong structural validity with correct JSON formatting and complete referential integrity. However, several edges are supported by only weak inference (confidence 2-3) where source evidence is indirect or speculative, particularly connections involving meta-preference learning and feature addition validation. The extraction successfully captures the main CIRL-based framework and approval-directed alternatives as presented in the source review, but misses several important problems Russell addresses (fully-updated deference obstacle, utility-reward gap specifics, ontological modification incentives, and multi-agent vision). After applying proposed fixes—adding 6 problem analysis nodes, deleting the underdeveloped meta-preference node, removing 4 weakly-supported edges, and adjusting maturity ratings downward for speculative interventions—the graph will achieve higher fidelity to source content and more defensible confidence ratings. The framework properly distinguishes between CIRL's theoretical promise and its unresolved implementation challenges as presented in the source."

      "COVERAGE GAP 3: Multi-agent vision mentioned ('Russell also has a vision of many agents, each working to reasonably pursue the wishes of their owners') but not represented; this is distinct from single-agent approval-directed design",
      "WEAK INFERENCE EDGE 1: Edge between 'Use CIRL' and 'Dynamic feature addition' rated confidence 2 due to source hedge: 'avoiding feature misspecification by (somehow) allowing for dynamic addition' - the word 'somehow' indicates uncertainty",
      "WEAK INFERENCE EDGE 2: Meta-preference learning appears only as speculative idea ('maybe we need meta-preference learning?') not as definite proposal, justifying deletion",
      "INTERPRETATION NOTE: Source distinguishes CIRL as Russell's main proposal vs approval-directed as a comparison framework for robustness analysis; both are positioned as conceptual rather than deployed",
      "MATURITY CALIBRATION: Interventions should mostly be Maturity 1-2 given source presents these as 'outlined research agenda' components, not pilot-tested systems",
      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: All nodes correctly typed; concept nodes lack intervention fields; intervention nodes have lifecycle/maturity with proper ranges"
