    "summary": "The extracted knowledge fabric has severe schema compliance issues: all 18 nodes lack required 'node_rationale' field, all intervention nodes (3) lack required lifecycle/maturity rationale fields, and all 18 edges lack required 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields. Referentially, all edge node references are valid with no orphans detected. However, critical coverage gaps exist: the fabric completely omits contractualist anti-natalism pathway (Section 2.2), Korsgaard self-defense doctrine (Section 2.1), agent-neutral rule-compliance incentives (Section 2.1), misanthropic anti-natalism (Section 2.1), identity-affecting act paralysis mechanism (Section 2.1), and foundational coherence problems with proposed safety interventions (Section 2.4). The extraction also misrepresents risk levels for existing nodes—presenting 'Weaken harm-benefit asymmetry' and 'Embed non-extinction rules' as viable interventions when source text explicitly identifies both as theoretically unresolved problems. After applying the 38 proposed fixes (12 new nodes, 14 new edges, 14 field corrections), the fabric will be schema-compliant and comprehensive, capturing all three distinct x-risk pathways (HBA anti-natalism, paralysis, non-aggregation) and contractualist pathway, with proper characterization of intervention theoretical status."
