      "DIRECTIONAL ERROR: Edges from 'Current widespread neglect of AI safety among AI companies' (validation evidence node) to implementation mechanism nodes use 'validated_by' but correct direction should be 'motivates' - evidence motivates interventions, not vice versa. Per instruction: 'All nodes building the rationale for a proposed intervention MUST flow INTO the intervention node'.",
      "LIFECYCLE ASSIGNMENT: Intervention 'Legislate mandatory AI safety audits before model deployment' assigned lifecycle 5 (Deployment) but should be 4 (Pre-Deployment Testing) as legislation sets pre-deployment requirements. Policy operates pre-deployment.",
      "MATURITY ASSIGNMENT: (1) 'Legislate mandatory AI safety audits' rated 2 (Experimental) - correct, EU AI Act is pilot phase; (2) 'Develop and disseminate training programs' rated 2 but should be 3 (Prototype/Pilot) as industry safety training exists in universities and organizations; (3) 'Provide tax incentives' rated 1 (Foundational) - correct, represents novel policy design.",

Design rationales and implementation mechanisms present. Three intervention nodes extracted. Missing synthesis node connecting four independent problem analyses to unified understanding of adoption failure mechanism.",

      "CONCEPTUAL GRANULARITY: Node names follow pattern '[Problem/Mechanism] in [Context]' appropriately - not too atomic, not too coarse. Examples: 'Perception that AGI is distant reduces urgency for safety adoption' (not just 'AGI distance' or 'Far timeline belief causes all adoption problems').",
      "KNOWLEDGE FABRIC PATHWAYS: Multiple paths from risk through problem analyses → theoretical insights → design rationales → implementation mechanisms → validation evidence → interventions exist and are connected. No isolated reasoning paths.",
      "SOURCE ALIGNMENT: All nodes grounded in explicit quotes or clear inferences from source text 'How do we actually get people to follow this solution?' and four enumerated reasons for ignoring safety. Inference confidence appropriately marked as 2 throughout (weak/light inference as per instructions)."
