    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has critical schema compliance issues: missing edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale, and node_rationale fields throughout all edges and nodes, plus missing intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale fields for both intervention nodes. Beyond schema blockers, the extraction significantly under-represents the source material by conflating eight distinct operations into a single design node and missing six implementation mechanism nodes for world-level definitions. The fabric lacks intermediate design rationale nodes explaining why four operation pairs (brothers/sisters) create distinct decomposition strategies. Validation evidence is substantially under-captured: three distinct validation evidence nodes should exist for (1) biextensional equivalence preservation, (2) lollipop/tensor equivalence, (3) idempotence proofs. Coverage analysis reveals six critical edges missing from the extraction. With proposed fixes applied (adding 12 concept nodes and 4 inference-based intervention nodes, restructuring edges with required rationale fields, and correcting node attribute mappings), the knowledge graph would accurately capture the complete causal-interventional pathway from boundary mis-specification risk through formal operations to deployable safety tooling."

      "SCHEMA BLOCKERS: All edges missing edge_confidence_rationale (required per final_output_format) - affects all 7 edges. All nodes missing node_rationale (required per final_output_format) - affects all 8 nodes. Both intervention nodes missing intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale (required per schema_requirements for type=intervention) - Section 1 does not show where lifecycle 1 and maturity 1 are justified.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: PASS - all 7 edges correctly reference existing nodes. No dangling references detected.",
      "ORPHAN NODES: PASS - all 8 nodes connected to fabric. Node connectivity verified across edges.",
      "GRANULARITY MISMATCH: Current node 'introduce committing, assuming, externalising and internalising to create additive/multiplicative sub-agents' conflates four distinct operations (CommitB, Commit∖B, ExternalB, External/B) into single design node. Section 1.1-1.4 clearly present these as separate paired operations: CommitB/Commit∖B are brothers (additive), ExternalB/External/B are sisters (multiplicative), AssumeF/Assume∖F are dual (multiplicative), InternalF/Internal/F are dual (multiplicative). Each pair has distinct design logic requiring separate rationale nodes per template structure.",
      "IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM UNDER-REPRESENTATION: Section 2 provides world-level extensions (CommitS, AssumeS, ExternalV, InternalV) with explicit statement 'Once we have the following definitions in hand, our future references to committing, assuming, externalizing, and internalizing will use the definitions from worlds unless noted otherwise.' This indicates world-level implementations are distinct from agent/environment-level implementations. Current extraction combines these into single node, violating separation-of-concerns.",
      "VALIDATION EVIDENCE UNDER-REPRESENTATION: Section 3 contains three major validation components: (1) Section 3.1 proves biextensional equivalence for all operations with extensive morphism constructions showing if C0≃C1 then operation preserves equivalence. (2) Section 3.2 proves CommitS(C)≅1S⊸C and AssumeS(C)≅1S⊗C with full morphism constructions. (3) Section 4 proves all eight operations idempotent. Current extraction captures only 'formal proofs of equivalence and idempotence' as single validation node. These should be separate nodes per evidence type.",
      "MISSING EDGES FROM SOURCE: (1) Edge from design rationale to ExternalV showing how duality (ExternalB and External/B are sisters) enables problem decomposition. (2) Edge showing Assume∖F operation recovers control in worlds with external events (Section 1.2 meteor example). (3) Edge from preservation of biextensional equivalence to idempotence proofs showing how preservation enables idempotence characterization. (4) Edge from lollipop/tensor equivalence to specification interventions showing how 1S semantics motivate practical use. (5) Multiple edges from individual validation evidence nodes to corresponding intervention nodes.",
      "INTERVENTION EXTRACTION UNDERPERFORMANCE: Only 2 explicit interventions extracted; source supports 4-6 distinct interventions from Sections 1.2 and template. Moderate inference appropriate here per instructions: CommitS/AssumeS for specifications (supported by Section 3.2 design pattern), ExternalV for problem decomposition (supported by Section 1.3 sister decomposition), frame operations in tooling (supported by multiple section references). All inferred interventions marked maturity 1-2 with explicit source references.",
      "EVIDENCE MAPPING: Risk 'mis-specification of boundaries' connects clearly to problem 'absence of operations' (implied from lack of tools in prior literature). Problem connects to insight 'subsets/partitions work' via Section 1.1-1.4 motivation. Insight connects to design via 'four operations' construction. Design connects to implementation via 'world-level definitions' in Section 2. Implementation connects to validation via 'proofs and idempotence' in Sections 3-4. Validation connects to interventions via 'motivates' edges (Section 3.2 discussion of practical use). All connections supported by evidence but require explicit rationale field additions.",
      "COMPLETENESS CHECK: Proposed fixes add 12 concept nodes capturing: 2 design rationale nodes (additive vs multiplicative), 6 implementation mechanism nodes (distinct world-level definitions for 8 operations split into 6 nodes due to duality structure), 4 validation evidence nodes (biextensional preservation × 2, tensor equivalence, idempotence × 2). Also add 4 intervention nodes covering: CommitS specification, AssumeS specification, ExternalV decomposition, frame operations tooling. These 16 additions plus restructured edges and field additions achieve complete knowledge fabric from risk through interventions."
