The graph captures reasonable causal pathways connecting semiconductor supply risks through diversification strategies to policy interventions, but requires substantial completion of required documentation fields and addition of 5 missing concept nodes with 5 supporting edges. With proposed fixes applied, the extraction would become valid and mergeable across domains."

      "BLOCKER 1: All nodes missing 'node_rationale' field (schema requirement per instructions). Every node must explain why essential to fabric with data source section reference. Example: node 'TSMC 54% foundry share' should cite 'Summary: TSMC controls 54% of the logic foundry market'",
      "BLOCKER 2: All edges missing 'edge_confidence_rationale' and 'edge_rationale' fields (schema requirements per final_output_format). Example edge from 'Geographical concentration' to 'Advanced semiconductor supply' should have confidence_rationale citing market concentration facts and edge_rationale from 'Summary' section",
      "BLOCKER 3: Intervention lifecycle values incorrectly set to 6, but schema defines only 1-6 scale with 5=Deployment, 6=Other. All policy interventions (subsidies, export controls, agreements) are deployment-phase actions and should be lifecycle=5",
      "MAJOR 1: Five significant nodes missing from extraction despite explicit source evidence: (1) '300mm wafer production concentration' from Summary quote 'Japan, Taiwan, Germany and South Korea manufacture the state-of-the-art 300 mm wafers used for 99.7 percent', (2) 'AMD dual GPU-CPU design expertise' from Summary quote 'AMD is currently the only company with expertise in designing both high-end GPUs and high-end CPUs', (3) 'Research productivity decline' from 'Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?' summary showing 18x R&D increase with constant innovation rate, (4) 'Wright's law theory' from 'Statistical Basis' paper forming foundation for cost reduction analysis, (5) 'Experience curve scaling economics' from 'Experience curves' article demonstrating 1000x scale enabling 10x cost reduction",
      "MAJOR 2: Concept_category misclassification: node 'Complex multistep semiconductor supply chain systemic fragility' categorized as 'theoretical insight' but source states as direct observed fact (>1000 steps, 70+ borders are empirical characteristics), should be 'problem analysis'",
      "MAJOR 3: Five critical edges missing that would complete knowledge fabric: (a) Risk→300mm wafer concentration bottleneck, (b) Risk→research productivity decline constraint, (c) Diversification→Wright's law economic justification, (d) Subsidies→experience curve cost reduction, (e) EDA monopoly→AMD expertise validation",
      "Coverage assessment: Extraction covers ~65% of major causal pathways from source. Semiconductor supply risk → geographic concentration → diversification → subsidies pathway is complete. However, missing connections to: (i) research productivity constraints limiting improvement pace, (ii) Wright's law and experience curve economics justifying subsidy ROI, (iii) 300mm wafer concentration adding third geographic bottleneck",
      "Referential integrity: All 22 edges reference existing nodes - no broken references detected",
      "Orphan analysis: No nodes completely disconnected. However, theoretical insight nodes (Wright's law, experience curves, research productivity decline) should exist but are missing",
      "Edge confidence calibration: Some edges rated 3 (Medium) that should be 4 (Strong) based on quantitative source evidence. Example: 'TSMC 54% foundry share' edge should be confidence=4 not 3, as source provides explicit numerical evidence with no equivocation",
      "Data source section traceability: Current extraction provides weak traceability - most edges cite section like 'Summary' generically without indicating specific claim. Proposed fixes require precise citations like 'Summary: TSMC controls 54% of the logic foundry market' for each edge",
      "Schema compliance: Node schema requires either concept_category OR (intervention_lifecycle + intervention_maturity), never both. All nodes comply. However, MISSING required fields: node_rationale (all nodes), edge_confidence_rationale (all edges), edge_rationale (all edges), intervention_lifecycle_rationale (intervention nodes), intervention_maturity_rationale (intervention nodes)"
