However, the JSON has critical schema violations: missing required fields (node_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale) across all nodes and edges, plus unnecessary 'embedding' fields. Additionally, edge directionality requires correction (ontology transition causality reversed), and intervention maturity/lifecycle assignments are too high given the prospective research design nature of the source. One validation evidence node (feature analysis) is missing. After the proposed fixes, the extraction would be valid and mergeable across domains."
