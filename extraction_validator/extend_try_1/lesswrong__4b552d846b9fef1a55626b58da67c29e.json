Additionally, there are referential integrity issues and orphaned nodes (e.g., 'Formation of ambitious maximizer goals' has zero edges despite being mentioned in source). The graph topology is substantially correct and captures major causal pathways from the source, but the coverage is incomplete: missing edges for process-based training mitigation, rapid takeoff conditional effects, and explicit luck-based success mechanisms. The extraction demonstrates moderate understanding of the source's reasoning but fails technical validation requirements and omits critical problem analysis nodes that should feed into the alignment problem pathway."

      "BLOCKER: All intervention nodes (nodes 25-29) missing 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' fields. Schema requires: 'justification with closest preceding data source section title reference'.",
      "MAJOR: Node 'Formation of ambitious maximizer goals in advanced AI systems' has zero incoming and zero outgoing edges despite being core objection discussed in source: 'It's arguably very hard to get even human-level-ish capabilities without ambitious misaligned aims' and 'How natural/necessary is it for a sufficiently capable AI to form ambitious goals' under 'The initial alignment problem' section.",
      "MAJOR: Missing edge between 'Deployment problem' and 'Moderate investment and luck can tilt aligned AI dominance'. Source states: 'we could be fine in worlds where they go ~maximally poorly; every little bit helps' - indicates luck mitigation applies to deployment problem.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Process-based training not represented as standalone mitigation node. Source distinguishes: 'Outcomes-based training seems abstractly more powerful, and likely to be a big part... but this isn't assured. Today, training AIs based on outcomes of long episodes is unwieldy' - this is design principle node missing.",
      "COVERAGE GAP: Rapid takeoff conditional effects not captured. Source asks: 'will this mostly be via increasing the number of AIs or by increasing per-AI capabilities?' (footnote 11) - current trajectory has two paths needing conditional branches.",
      "VALIDATION EVIDENCE: Edge confidence for watchdog pathway may be overstated. Source: 'There are tons of reasons this might not work, but I don't think we should be shocked if it produces huge dividends' - suggests confidence 2, not 3.",
      "SCHEMA: All edges have extraneous 'embedding' field (null) not in required schema specification - must be removed.",
      "EVIDENCE CITATION: Intervention maturity assessment for adversarial training at 2 is supported by source language: 'It's plausible to me that AI companies might invest heavily in this kind of work... It seems plausible to me that adversarial training could undo a lot of misalignment' (speculative, not validated).",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE PATTERN: Source consistently uses hedging language ('It seems plausible', 'It's imaginable', 'I would guess') suggesting confidence 2-3 appropriate for most theory-level edges connecting alignment mechanisms.",
      "SOURCE SECTION TRACEABILITY: Graph successfully traces back to source sections but rationale fields omit closest section references - all fixes require adding section title citations per schema requirement 'closest preceding data source section title reference'."
