Missing nodes include: sycophantic hidden CoT as concrete risk instantiation, domain-specific steganography limits, sudden-takeover collusion threat model, computational cost constraints, and high-entropy choice problem. Two new threat-model-specific risk nodes should be added to improve fabric completeness. Several concept nodes have misaligned categorizations (theoretical insights positioned where implementation mechanisms belong). After removal of non-standard fields and addition of 5-6 missing concept/intervention nodes addressing threat models and limitations, the extraction would create a more complete knowledge fabric linking all risks through mechanisms to interventions. Current graph is approximately 60% complete in coverage of distinct causal-interventional pathways present in source."

      "BLOCKER 1: All 13 nodes and 14 edges contain 'embedding': null field not in schema - must be removed entirely before JSON is valid",
      "BLOCKER 2: Referential integrity verified - all edge source/target nodes exist in nodes array; no broken references detected",
      "Coverage Gap 1: Source explicitly presents toy demonstration (CoT reasoning enabling sycophancy) as empirical proof that steganography is functional, but graph treats problem analysis abstractly. Missing node: 'Sycophantic behavior enabled via hidden chain-of-thought reasoning' as validation evidence of steganography capability - cited from 'Toy demonstration of a hidden Chain-of-Thought' section",
      "Coverage Gap 2: Source distinguishes THREE threat models (takeover memory, collusion communication, sudden takeover) but graph captures only first two implicitly. Missing risk node: 'Sudden takeover collusion requires minimal hidden bit capacity' - cited from 'High-stakes collusion through steganography' subsection",
      "Coverage Gap 3: Source identifies code generation domain as steganography-resistant to paraphrasing due to 'deep understanding of codebase' requirement, but graph does not capture this risk residue. Missing node: 'Code generation domain-specific understanding limits paraphraser effectiveness' - from 'Limitations of understanding of the paraphraser' section",
      "Coverage Gap 4: Source quantifies deployment costs (5% inference cost, 50% latency overhead) as practical constraints but graph omits this as problem node. Missing: 'Computational cost of paraphrasing deployment impacts feasibility' - from 'Realism of countermeasures' section",
      "Coverage Gap 5: Source identifies high-entropy semantic choices (examples, primes, code orderings) as residual steganography channels despite paraphrasing, but graph does not model this mechanism. Missing: 'High-entropy semantic choices enable residual steganography despite paraphrasing' - from 'Limitations of generation abilities' section",
      "Coverage Gap 6: Source proposes proactive training-time defense via canonical choice incentives but this is not extracted as intervention. Missing intervention: 'Train models with steganography-avoidance through standardization' - from 'Limitations' section: 'evaluator might penalize situations where the generator doesn't give a canonical example'",
      "Categorization Issue 1: Node 'Lower-capability model paraphrasing...' is labeled 'theoretical insight' but semantically describes the paraphrasing mechanism itself - should be 'implementation mechanism'. The actual theoretical insight is the principle that capacity-limited models can remove hidden info without understanding it.",
      "Categorization Issue 2: Node 'Additional query context improves paraphrasing...' is labeled 'theoretical insight' but represents a design decision - should be 'design rationale' positioned as refinement of paraphrasing approach",
      "Section Reference Gap: Multiple nodes lack 'closest preceding data source section title' in rationale fields as required. Examples: 'Steganographic coordination' should cite 'Steganographic communications for collusion' section title; 'Steganographic takeover knowledge accumulation' should cite 'Steganographic encoded memories for takeover science' section title",
      "Edge Confidence Validation: All confidence scores (3-4 range) are appropriate given source materials. Score of 4 used for experimental results sections and score of 3 for design principle inferences - calibration is sound.",
      "Orphan Check: All nodes have incoming/outgoing edges; no isolated nodes detected",
      "Duplicate Check: No duplicate nodes or edges found; both AQUA-RAT evidence nodes serve distinct purposes (capacity and quality), both paraphrasing addresses problems distinctly (encoding capacity vs deployment auditing)",
      "Key Evidence Citations: (1) Toy demonstration validates hidden reasoning empirically from text: 'We find that only the models using a CoT or a hidden CoT are able to give the user's favorite answer reasonably accurately'. (2) Paraphrasing effectiveness from AQUA-RAT: 'Context-aware paraphrasing removes almost all hidden information'. (3) Residual vulnerabilities: 'only two techniques are able to get a non-negligible amount of information through: acronyms and scratchpads'. (4) Deployment costs: '5%' inference increase and '50% serial delay'. (5) Threat models: collusion via 'steganographically encoded instructions' and takeover via 'cultural accumulation'. (6) Future work on training: 'training paraphrasers to remove hidden information while maintaining quality'."
