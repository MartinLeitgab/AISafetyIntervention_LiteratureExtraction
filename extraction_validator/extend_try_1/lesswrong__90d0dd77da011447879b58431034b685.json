The graph demonstrates good structural coverage of the main causal pathway (risk → problem → theory → design → implementation → validation → intervention) and correctly identifies 16 nodes and 16 edges. However, the graph misses critical distinctions: (1) that the work produces ModFDT rather than pure FDT due to parameter integration, (2) the explicit base model comparison establishing intervention effectiveness, and (3) edge cases where the model deviates. Three nodes should be relocated or reclassified (Newcomb's paradox example, narrative embedding philosophy vs ATL technique). Four proposed additional nodes and four new edges would complete coverage. After applying all proposed fixes, the knowledge fabric would validly represent the complete causal-interventional reasoning from decision theory misalignment risks through the ATL intervention with comprehensive validation evidence."
