Missing required attributes (node_rationale, edge_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale) violate schema compliance. More significantly, the extraction missed three of four primary communication strategies presented in the source (merging similar terms, establishing formal definitions, and transparency), reducing coverage to approximately 25%. The fabricated AI deployment intervention contradicts instructions by applying heavy rather than light inference and introducing content unsupported by the purely human-communication-focused source material. With proposed fixes applied, the graph would achieve schema compliance and capture the complete knowledge fabric of multiple interconnected communication strategies flowing from the common risk and theoretical foundation through distinct implementation mechanisms."
