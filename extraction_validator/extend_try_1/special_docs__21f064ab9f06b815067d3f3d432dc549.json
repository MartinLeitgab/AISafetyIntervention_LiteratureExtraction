    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph is structurally sound with correct referential integrity and comprehensive node/edge coverage of the paper's causal-interventional pathways. However, the extraction violates schema requirements by missing mandatory edge attributes (edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale) and node attributes (node_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale) across all entries. Additionally, one edge (Safety skimping → Information sharing) uses incorrect directionality with 'caused_by' when 'enabled_by' would be more precise. Three missing concept nodes would enhance fabric completeness: theoretical assumptions underpinning rationality, the three information scenarios as an analytical framework, and the information-coordination trade-off. These gaps are readily fixable with the proposed additions and field updates. The knowledge fabric correctly identifies all four major intervention categories (coordination, research steering, information control, consolidation) and traces them through the model's parameter analysis (e, Π, n, information) to conclude with four operational interventions validated by equilibrium simulations."

Extracted JSON omits node_rationale entirely from all 19 concept nodes and omits both intervention rationale fields from all 4 intervention nodes. EVIDENCE: SCHEMA_REQUIREMENTS section 'Intervention Node Attributes' and processed_strategy step_2 explicitly require these fields. FIX: Add all missing rationale fields with source section references per proposed_fixes.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: Verified all 22 edges reference node names that exist in node list. No broken references found. Example verification: edge 'source_node: Safety skimping incentives in AI arms race' matches node at index 1 exactly.",

DATA SOURCE EVIDENCE Section 2.2-2.3: 'When teams know their own or any other team's capabilities...the team increases its probability of winning by...' Information is enabling condition, not causal origin. The skimping incentive arises from race structure (winning reward e, losing probability 1/n); information makes rational expression more aggressive. FIX: Change to 'enabled_by' with confidence 2 or remove entirely and reconstruct via separate chains.",
      "COVERAGE ANALYSIS: Four major intervention categories identified in source Section 3 are all present: (1) coordination addressing enmity e - represented; (2) research steering addressing Π - represented; (3) information control addressing information hazard - represented; (4) consolidation addressing n - represented. Model results Figures 1-3 validate all four pathways.",
      "MISSING NODES - THEORETICAL LAYER: Source explicitly assumes 'teams choose safety based on Nash equilibrium considerations' (Section 2) but extracted graph treats this as single black-box node rather than decomposing foundational assumptions. DATA SOURCE: Section 2 'We'll assume that each team maximises expected utility' - this is separate theoretical assumption. Added as 'Team rationality via expected utility maximization in AI race' node.",
      "MISSING NODES - FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE: Source Section 2 explicitly analyzes 'three information scenarios' as distinct analytical cases but extracted graph references scenarios only implicitly. Recommended extraction practice requires decomposing frameworks. Added 'Three information scenarios in AI arms race analysis' node.",
      "MISSING NODES - CONSTRAINTS: Source Section 3.3 footnote 5 explicitly identifies trade-off: 'Such secrecy can interfere with trust building, though, making it hard to reach agreements between teams if such agreement is needed.' This is important constraint on information containment intervention. Added 'Information containment versus trust-building coordination trade-off' node with 'causes_conflict_with' edge.",
      "NOTATION CONSISTENCY: Extracted nodes use ϖ (lowercase pi) for capability parameter. DATA SOURCE consistently uses Π (capital pi). Example Section 3.1: 'for a single given Π. A high Π corresponds to a situations where capability is dominant'. FIX: Change all instances to capital Π.",
      "VALIDATION EVIDENCE: Equilibrium model simulations node (index 19) correctly references Figures 1-3 and their role in validating theoretical predictions. DATA SOURCE Sections 3.1-3.4 explicitly present and interpret these figures.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY ASSESSMENT: All four interventions correctly assigned Maturity 1 (Foundational/Theoretical). EVIDENCE: Section 3.2 uses conditional language 'we could also consider agreements'; Section 3.1 states 'Our best bet might be at present'; Section 3.3 acknowledges 'Our ability to manipulate...is likely to be somewhat limited'; Section 3.4 notes practical difficulty. No implementations described. Correct assignment.",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE ASSESSMENT: All four interventions correctly assigned Lifecycle 6 (Other/Policy). EVIDENCE: None fall within technical development phases 1-5 (model design, pretraining, fine-tuning, testing, deployment). All are governance/policy/institutional interventions per source discussions of treaties, funding policy, disclosure norms, and regulatory incentives.",

This reflects: SOURCE EVIDENCE present but requires inference about causal mechanism. Direct quote: 'Each team is incentivised to finish first { by skimping on safety precautions' establishes correlation but reasoning chain requires reading model setup.",

Example: 'Disaster probability decreases with lower enmity' node connects (1) to problem node 'High enmity' via 'mitigates'; (2) to design rationale 'Promote coordination' via 'refined_by'; (3) to implementation 'International agreements' via 'enabled_by'; (4) to intervention via 'motivates'. Forms connected fabric rather than isolated reasoning paths.",
