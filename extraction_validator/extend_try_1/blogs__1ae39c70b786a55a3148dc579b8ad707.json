    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has valid JSON structure and complete referential integrity, with all 12 nodes properly connected and no orphaned components. However, it violates the mandatory schema requirements by missing required fields (node_rationale for all nodes, intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale for intervention nodes, and edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale for all edges), and contains invalid 'embedding' fields. The knowledge fabric is substantially complete in capturing the core causal-interventional pathway from regression errors → specification flaws → mechanistic deconstruction → systematic audit → manual and automated implementation → case study validation → three intervention proposals. Two significant enhancements would strengthen coverage: (1) adding a problem-analysis node about the pervasiveness of regression in social science to motivate intervention scale, and (2) adding a theoretical-insight node about fundamental coefficient instability to broaden the design rationale beyond specific methodological errors. The intervention nodes understate maturity (marked as 2 when evidence supports only maturity 1) and use inappropriate lifecycle categories, suggesting the original extraction was careless about evidence grounding. With the proposed fixes applied, this would be valid and mergeable across knowledge graphs."

      "BLOCKER SEVERITY: Missing required fields (node_rationale on all nodes, intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale on intervention nodes, edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale on all edges) violates schema section 2 of original prompt which explicitly states these are mandatory. The phrase 'all required data attributes' must include these fields across all instances.",
      "SCHEMA VIOLATION: Extraction includes 'embedding' field (null values) not in required schema. This is extraneous.",
      "REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY: All 13 node references in edges correctly match node names in nodes array. No broken references detected.",
      "ORPHAN ANALYSIS: Graph is fully connected with no isolated nodes. Every concept node has at least one incoming and one outgoing edge; intervention nodes appropriately have only incoming edges.",
      "EVIDENCE GROUNDING: Aaron Rodgers example directly supports axis-swap problem (confidence 3-4 justified). NBA time-zone example directly supports artifacts problem. OBP/SLG case studies directly support multicollinearity problem. All three are refinements of broader 'subtle methodological flaws' - this structure is sound.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 1: Source emphasizes regression is 'VERY common in social science research' and 'Kind of a bad combination' - this context establishing prevalence/scale is not captured as distinct concept node. Adding 'Pervasive reliance on regression analysis for causal claims in social-science research' as problem_analysis node would strengthen motivation for interventions.",
      "COVERAGE GAP 2: Source final conclusion 'I think the issues here are extremely general, and not good news for the practice of treating regression coefficients as effect sizes' identifies theoretical insight that could be distinct node. Current extraction treats this as motivation for multiple interventions but doesn't make the theoretical insight explicit in the graph.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY: Original extraction assigns maturity 2 (Experimental/Proof-of-Concept) to training intervention and maturity 1 to software and policy interventions. Source provides no evidence of existing training programs, deployed software, or journal policy implementations. All three are best classified as maturity 1 (Foundational/Theoretical) since they are inferred from case studies.",
      "INTERVENTION LIFECYCLE: Original extraction assigns lifecycle 6 (Other) to training and policy interventions, but lifecycle 1 (Model Design) to software. This is inconsistent and unclear. Training and policy are organizational interventions best classified as lifecycle 6. Software for research methodology is also lifecycle 6 (not tied to model design phases). Current assignment needs correction.",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION: Original extraction uses confidence 2-3 range for most edges, which is appropriate for moderate inference. However, missing edge_confidence_rationale field on all edges prevents audit of whether confidence assignments are justified by evidence.",
      "DATA SOURCE ALIGNMENT: All 13 nodes are grounded in specific sections of source material (Aaron Rodgers, NBA time-zone, younger brothers, OBP/SLG, Birnbaum characterization). No nodes are unsupported.",
      "FABRIC CONNECTIVITY: Graph forms single connected component with no isolated reasoning paths. Primary path: risk → problem analysis → three problem mechanisms in parallel → theoretical insight → design rationale → two implementation mechanisms in parallel → validation evidence → three interventions in parallel. This structure is sound.",
      "INSTRUCTION ADHERENCE: Original instructions require 'Extraction must be consistent, complete, and mergeable across AI scientific domains.' The domain here is not AI but research methodology/statistics. This is outside the originally intended 500k AI safety sources. However, regression analysis is highly relevant to AI safety research effectiveness evaluation, so the extraction is in-scope for mergeability with other research methodology sources.",
      "MERGEABLE NAMING: Node names follow granularity rules - not too atomic ('axis selection' alone) nor too coarse ('regression causes errors'). Aliases provide 2-3 alternative phrasings per schema. Naming is mergeable across sources discussing regression problems."
