    "summary": "The extraction has multiple BLOCKER-level schema issues (missing node_rationale and edge rationale fields from all nodes/edges, missing intervention lifecycle/maturity justifications) preventing validation. Beyond schema, the extracted graph contains two inferred interventions (chain-of-thought prompting, pre-deployment benchmarking) that are NOT actually proposed in the source material, which is purely diagnostic/analytical. The source also demonstrates failed attempts at prompt engineering (limited improvement), contradicting claims that prompt framing is a validated insight. Critical problem-analysis relationships are mischaracterized. However, the core causal structure is sound: risk → shallow pattern-matching → validation evidence. With systematic corrections (restoring required fields, removing inferred interventions, adding scammer/human baseline comparisons, fixing node categories/descriptions), the graph would accurately represent the source's diagnostic findings about AI reasoning brittleness."

      "SCHEMA CRITICAL: All nodes missing mandatory node_rationale field; all edges missing mandatory edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields. Instructions require these; extraction omitted them entirely.",
      "INTERVENTION FABRICATION: Nodes 'Use chain-of-thought prompting during deployment' and 'Establish pre-deployment benchmark' are INFERRED, not extracted. Source text never proposes these solutions. Source ends with scammer failure, not with proposed mitigations. This violates the distinction between moderate inference (allowed with confidence 1-2 marking) and fabricating entire interventions.",
      "CATEGORY ERROR: Node 'Prompt framing influences depth of reasoning in LLMs' labeled as theoretical_insight but evidence contradicts it. Source states 'More sophisticated prompt framing yields LIMITED IMPROVEMENT' - this is negative evidence of failure, not validation of insight. Should be problem_analysis.",
      "MISSING COVERAGE: No node for human baseline (Jess's multi-factor reasoning). Critical for showing what correct reasoning looks like. Missing edge between human baseline and validation evidence.",
      "MISSING COVERAGE: No node for banana-as-learned-pattern mechanism. Source explicitly cites Anisha Sensa explaining 'banana is a classic' joke food - this is key to understanding the pattern-matching mechanism.",
      "MISSING COVERAGE: Scammer bot failure case mentioned in source but minimally integrated. Should be separate validation evidence node.",
      "EDGE CONFIDENCE MISALIGNED: Edge from 'More sophisticated prompting' to validation evidence marked confidence=3 but direct experimental comparison should be confidence=4.",
      "INFERRED VS DIAGNOSTIC: Source is purely diagnostic (demonstrates problem via Turing test) not prescriptive (does not propose solutions). The article demonstrates failure, demonstrates that prompting helps only marginally, and ends with continued failure. No mitigation strategies are proposed. Extraction incorrectly treated this diagnostic analysis as basis for prescriptive interventions.",
      "ATTENUATION ISSUE: The edge 'motivates' from limited-improvement evidence to chain-of-thought intervention represents logical leap. Limited improvement does NOT logically motivate adoption of chain-of-thought; it suggests the opposite (that prompt engineering has limits).",
      "QUOTE EVIDENCE - Perfect human answer: 'I asked my partner Jess and she said a banana which is pretty much a perfect answer: it's heavy enough to hold the pages open, it's long and thin so it won't cover all the text, it's curved so it won't roll off, and it has a skin so it won't mess up the book.' - Shows explicit multi-factor reasoning entirely absent in GPT-3 responses.",
      "QUOTE EVIDENCE - Banana frequency: 'Banana is a great answer; I was struck that GPT-3 gives banana as an answer so often, yet is almost completely unable to explain why.'",
      "QUOTE EVIDENCE - Scammer failure: 'How did my scammer do with this question? Not great: I don\\'t understand what you mean. Me: Would you prop a book open with cake? Amy: I think it will put!'",
      "QUOTE EVIDENCE - Limited prompt improvement: 'Note that *all* the text is generated by GPT-3... Friend: Why pancakes? Because they are soft and they are like a stack of books. Friend: Books are stacked on top of each other and pancakes look like a stack of books.' - Incoherent reasoning despite sophisticated prompting.",
      "THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FROM SOURCE: 'Rob Bensinger asked me to post it here: it's a great example of what folks like Eliezer mean when they claim that GPT-3 is doing shallow pattern-matching, not really making sense at all, etc.' - This is the core claim being validated."
