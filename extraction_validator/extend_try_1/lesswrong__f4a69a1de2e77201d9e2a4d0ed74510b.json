These are BLOCKER-level issues per schema requirements. Beyond schema fixes, the graph significantly undercaptures the source's modeling framework: missing nodes for AGI timeline distribution, aging solution timeline, conditional survival probabilities, and the failure-to-solve-aging risk pathway. Three intervention nodes have incorrect maturity/lifecycle assignments (interventions 1, 2, 3). With all proposed fixes applied, the graph becomes valid and mergeable, though extraction coverage of the source's quantitative modeling apparatus remains incomplete despite covering main causal pathways."
