    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the core theoretical framework from DATA_SOURCE but contains multiple schema violations (missing required fields: node_rationale, edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale) that are BLOCKERS under the specified output format. Additionally, edge confidence ratings are inflated relative to the source material (which contains no empirical validation), intervention lifecycle/maturity classifications are imprecise, and one edge represents unsupported inference. After applying proposed fixes (restoring schema compliance, adjusting confidence levels to 1-2, correcting lifecycle/maturity values, and removing unsupported inference edges), the graph would be valid and mergeable. The extraction demonstrates good conceptual coverage of the DATA_SOURCE but requires technical corrections to meet specification requirements."
