    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the core reasoning paths from risks through theoretical insights to proposed interventions with good coverage of the main alignment-for-ML research agenda. However, the JSON structure contains BLOCKER-level schema violations: all nodes lack required node_rationale fields, all edges lack required edge_confidence_rationale and edge_rationale fields, and all intervention nodes lack required intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale fields. Additionally, the extraction is missing two important concept nodes (environmental goals, MIRI dual-agenda positioning) and corresponding edges that complete the fabric as described in source sections on the 8 research areas and connections between research agendas. The referential integrity is sound with no orphaned nodes, but field completeness must be addressed before validity."
