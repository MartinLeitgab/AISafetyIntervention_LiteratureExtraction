Additionally, concept categorization errors exist (e.g., 'validation evidence' misapplied to predictive statements) and significant coverage gaps exist around job displacement, regulatory convergence, trademark monopolization, and model feedback loops. The extraction captures the primary causal pathway from data scraping → privacy violations → regulatory risk → interventions, but misses important secondary risks and evidence chains. JSON is technically valid but schema-incomplete; knowledge fabric is logically sound but content-incomplete relative to source material."

This is a major thematic gap.",

Keep separate.",

Should be maturity 3 (Prototype/Pilot). 'Synthetic data generation' marked maturity 1 correctly - appropriately speculative.",

Secondary pathways (job displacement → litigation, trademark monopoly → innovation harm) poorly captured. Tertiary systemic risks (cross-model training loops, common crawl propagation) omitted.",
