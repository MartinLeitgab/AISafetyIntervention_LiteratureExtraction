    "summary": "The extracted knowledge fabric contains critical structural errors: it fundamentally mischaracterizes the source material as an AI systems engineering text when DATA_SOURCE is actually a pedagogical mathematics explanation of logarithms using digit-wheel metaphors. All seven original nodes and their connecting edges are based on false premises—specifically, treating a teaching tool (digit wheels) as an actual system design proposal, and fabricating AI safety/engineering contexts that do not appear in the source. The JSON schema is incomplete, missing required rationale fields. While the referential integrity is technically sound (all nodes referenced in edges exist), the semantic content is severely misaligned with source material. Comprehensive reconstruction is required: delete all seven original nodes and six original edges, add eight corrected concept nodes and one corrected intervention node with seven new edges grounded in actual source content."
