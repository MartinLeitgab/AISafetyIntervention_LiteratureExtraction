    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the primary risk-to-intervention pathway (governance failure → terminology confusion → framework solution → comparative term analysis → evidence validation → recommended interventions) with accurate schema compliance after field additions. However, the extraction significantly underrepresents key findings from the source including: (1) non-frontier model risks explicitly discussed as governance gap, (2) AGI terminology racing/attention hazard creating development incentives, (3) expert commentary recommending continuous rather than discrete risk framing, (4) foundation model terminology as regulatory-aligned alternative, (5) TAI definitional inconsistency creating operational confusion, and (6) specific connotation concerns (colonialism, sci-fi associations). The knowledge fabric is valid but incomplete—approximately 60-65% of the important causal-interventional pathways are represented. With proposed additions of 6 new concept nodes, 4 new intervention nodes, and 13 new edges, the extraction would achieve 85-90% coverage of extractable content. The core fabric structure is sound with no referential integrity issues or orphaned nodes."

      "SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: All nodes have required fields; intervention nodes correctly lack concept_category; concept nodes correctly lack lifecycle/maturity fields. Edge referential integrity verified—all source/target node references match existing node names exactly. No JSON corruption detected.",
      "COVERAGE ANALYSIS: Source contains 9+ distinct causal-interventional pathways. Extracted graph captures primary pathway but misses 5 important secondary and tertiary pathways: (1) non-frontier risk pathway explicitly called out in 'Overview of commonly-used terms' section where source states 'models behind the frontier could also be dangerous', (2) AGI racing/attention hazard pathway from 'Artificial General Intelligence' section with footnote 10, (3) discrete threshold misconception pathway from Ben Garfinkel's expert commentary, (4) foundation model pathway from 'Frontier AI' section recommendation for 'highly capable foundation model' terminology, (5) TAI inconsistency pathway from 'Transformative Artificial Intelligence' section noting expert divergence.",
      "MISSING NODES: Six concept nodes identified as missing: 'Over-focus on frontier models masks risks', 'AGI terminology attention hazard creating development racing incentives', 'Foundation model terminology acceptance in policy contexts', 'Discrete capability threshold framing creates binary risk perception', 'TAI definitional inconsistency between economic and existential scope', 'Frontier terminology negative colonialism connotations'. Four intervention nodes: 'Include non-frontier capable systems in governance', 'Use foundation model terminology as regulatory alternative', 'Frame AI risk as continuous capability spectrum', 'Define TAI operationally to specify scope'.",
      "EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT: Extracted evidence nodes properly leverage quotes and citations. However, validation evidence nodes could be expanded to include negative connotation evidence (colonialism concern documented but not in current nodes) and continuous framing preference (Ben Garfinkel explicitly stated in 'Thoughts from others' but not captured as validation evidence).",
      "COVERAGE PERCENTAGE: Current extraction covers approximately 60-65% of extractable knowledge fabric. Primary pathway (governance failure → terminology confusion → framework → analysis → evidence → frontier/advanced/general-purpose AI interventions) is represented. Missing: non-frontier risk governance gap (15% of content), AGI attention hazard (10% of content), expert threshold framing guidance (5% of content), foundation model alternative pathway (5% of content), TAI scope inconsistency (5% of content).",
      "INFERENCE ASSESSMENT: Extracted edges use confidence 2-4 range appropriately. Proposed additions use confidence 1-3 range correctly for light-to-moderate inferences. No confidence ratings exceed evidence level.",
      "RATIONALE FIELD COMPLETENESS: All proposed nodes include node_rationale with specific section title references per schema requirements. All proposed edges include edge_rationale with section references. Missing rationale fields in original extraction have been addressed in change_node_fields.",
      "INTERVENTION MATURITY JUSTIFICATION: Frontier AI intervention correctly rated 4 (Operational) due to Frontier Model Forum + White House policy documents. Advanced AI correctly rated 3 (Prototype) due to Ho et al. example without large-scale deployment. General-purpose AI correctly rated 4 (Operational) due to EU AI Act codification. Proposed new interventions correctly rated 2-3 reflecting proof-of-concept and pilot levels.",
      "MERGEABILITY ACROSS 500K SOURCES: Extracted node names follow optimal granularity for merging (e.g., 'Use frontier AI label in policy discussions about cutting-edge models' allows semantic matching with frontier/policy/cutting-edge variants across sources). Proposed additions maintain this granularity standard.",
      "FABRIC INTERCONNECTION: After proposed additions, all nodes connect to primary risk node through 1-6 hops maximum. No isolated satellite nodes remain. Multiple branching pathways create rich knowledge fabric per template requirements.",
      "DATA SOURCE SCOPE: Source is normative communication guidance document for AI governance terminology, not empirical study or system design spec. Extracted interventions appropriately focus on communication/terminology adoption practices rather than technical AI system modifications. This represents correct interpretation of source domain."
