Three required schema fields are missing from all edges (edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale) and all nodes (node_rationale), making the current JSON non-compliant. Conceptually, the graph under-represents the empirical evidence layer (Sandberg-Bostrom scale and GPT-3 statistics are referenced but not explicitly modeled), and contains a significant conceptual misclassification (compute parity should be validation evidence, not problem analysis). Edge directions need reversal in one case (compute parity should motivate rather than be refined by theoretical insight). Intervention maturity assignments lack sufficient data source grounding and should both be 1 (Foundational/Theoretical) given the speculative nature. After applying all proposed fixes, the extraction would form a valid, coherent knowledge fabric suitable for merging across safety research domains."
