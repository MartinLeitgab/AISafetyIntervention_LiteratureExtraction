Additionally, three edges reference valid nodes but lack theoretical justification in the DATA_SOURCE (enabled_by from accountability to arms control, required_by from accountability to detection, refined_by from accountability to rights recognition). The JSON structure itself is valid but incomplete per instructions. The fabric captures four of five major risk pathways adequately (surveillance→totalitarianism, metrics→auditing, weapons→treaties, propaganda→detection), but misses nuanced theoretical insights about abundance reducing competitive pressure and the stagnation prerequisite for slow-rolling catastrophe. With proposed fixes applied (adding ~10 new nodes/edges, populating required fields, removing three unjustified edges), the extraction would achieve 85%+ coverage of the source's reasoning chains and be mergeable across datasets with consistent naming."

Checking DATA_SOURCE sections: accountability discussed in Premise 2 (corporate/institutional); arms control in Premise 3/Structural risks. No text links these concepts.",
