    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph demonstrates strong schema compliance and captures the main causal-interventional pathway from long-tail VA task demand through developer bottlenecks, to the solution of domain-independent end-user instruction of non-branching programs. However, there are critical issues: (1) the first edge has reversed causality - developer limitations cause unmet demand, not vice versa, (2) six required fields (edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale) are missing from all edges per specification, (3) important theoretical insights (variable equivalence) and implementation mechanisms (unification matching, clarification subsystem) are not represented, (4) the failure analysis breakdown is not captured despite being crucial for interpreting validation results, and (5) the quantitative evidence that adjacent variables affect <5% of real commands should be elevated to validation evidence. These issues are largely fixable without restructuring the fabric. The extraction correctly identifies all major concept nodes and intervention nodes, but edge documentation and some concept nodes need augmentation to meet specification requirements and capture the full reasoning chain."

DATA_SOURCE states 'There will never be enough VA developers to customize VAs...The only way to close the gap is to enable non-technical end-users.' Developer limitations CAUSE unsatisfied demand. Edge must be reversed.",
      "MISSING THEORETICAL INSIGHT: Section 3.1 'A key insight that makes it possible to learn from only one example is that, typically, each variable value in the example command is the same as a parameter value in the UI script.' - This critical insight bridging one-shot learning theory to the learner algorithm is not captured as separate node.",

      "INCOMPLETE LIMITATIONS: Section 3.3 provides quantitative evidence 'adjacent variables in only 5 out of 236 Siri commands, 3 out of 91 Cortana, 1 out of 98 GoogleNow' - this <5% frequency should be elevated to validation evidence showing minimal real-world impact.",
