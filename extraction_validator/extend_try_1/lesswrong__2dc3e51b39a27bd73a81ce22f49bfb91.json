    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph captures the primary reasoning pathway from Oracle AI escape risks through epiphenomenal self-modeling and Nash equilibrium game theory to proposed interventions, with good structural coherence. However, the JSON has critical schema violations (missing required fields for all nodes and edges, including edge_confidence_rationale, edge_rationale, and node_rationale), contains unspecified 'embedding' fields, and maturity assessments misalign with source's explicit epistemic uncertainty. The graph omits two important theoretical insights (anvil problem inversion and acausal cooperation literature findings) that are central to the reasoning fabric. With fixes applied, the extraction would be valid and mergeable across domains, demonstrating complete causal pathways from both identified risks to both proposed interventions with appropriate theoretical grounding."
