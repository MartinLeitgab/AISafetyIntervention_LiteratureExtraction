    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph has CRITICAL SCHEMA BLOCKERS: missing mandatory fields 'node_rationale' on all 33 nodes, missing 'edge_rationale' on all 31 edges, and missing intervention rationale fields on 6 intervention nodes. These are non-negotiable per schema requirements. Additionally, the fabric is INCOMPLETE: it misses 6 important concept nodes derived directly from source text (counterfactual mugging asymmetry, causal production requirement, oracle acausal trade risk, FAI mitigation distinction, discount+finalization mechanism, oracle defense asymmetry) and 6 corresponding edges. While the core causal-interventional pathways are structurally sound and well-organized, the extraction fails mandatory compliance and coverage standards. After applying all proposed fixes, the graph would be valid and mergeable across 500k sources, achieving ~85% extraction completeness."

      "BLOCKER SEVERITY: Intervention nodes (6 total) missing 'intervention_lifecycle_rationale' and 'intervention_maturity_rationale' fields - mandatory per schema for all intervention nodes",
      "MAJOR ISSUE: Source section 'Beginning the chain' explicitly states Wei Dai insight about counterfactual mugging - NOT CAPTURED as node, violates 'extract every distinct claim that is part of core reasoning pathways'",
      "MAJOR ISSUE: Source section 'Requirements and restrictions' emphasizes predictions must CAUSALLY PRODUCE UFAIs - this distinction (cause vs enable) not explicit in fabric",
      "MAJOR ISSUE: Source EDIT section explicitly states 'if Oracles can do acausal trade with each other, they can produce an UFAI directly' - represents entirely separate risk pathway NOT IN FABRIC",
      "MAJOR ISSUE: Source section 'Requirements and restrictions' notes FAI bucket chains are less severe - context/comparison node missing",

      "MAJOR ISSUE: Source section 'Guarding and shutting down the Oracles' states 'easier to prevent outside takeover of a shutdown system, versus inside takeover' - strategic insight not extracted as validation node",

      "ACCURACY: All 6 intervention nodes use appropriate lifecycle and maturity designations, though rationales are missing",
      "STRUCTURE: Core fabric structure is sound - all 31 edges follow proper causal-interventional flow through 6 concept categories to interventions; no direct risk-intervention edges",
