The causal logic contains one significant error (edge from problem analysis to theoretical insight using 'addressed_by' when it should be 'caused_by'). Additionally, the graph applies moderate inference to construct the implementation mechanism and intervention nodes without explicit source support, which requires lower confidence ratings (1-2) and must be documented in rationale fields. The graph is missing one important node for theoretical completeness (competing hypotheses about utility function viability) and two supporting edges that establish the rationalist assumption context. After proposed fixes are applied, the graph would represent a valid, well-supported knowledge fabric covering the AI safety relevance of human preference incomparability."
