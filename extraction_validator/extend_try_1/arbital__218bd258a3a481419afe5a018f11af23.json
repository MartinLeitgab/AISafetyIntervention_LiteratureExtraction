    "summary": "The extracted knowledge graph violates fundamental instruction requirements by fabricating an AI safety risk narrative on top of a pure mathematics tutorial document. The source text contains zero content about AI systems, formal verification, specification errors, safety concerns, or interventions. The extraction applied heavy unjustified inference (edges marked confidence 2) to create a 6-node causal pathway ending in an AI safety policy intervention that has no textual basis. The JSON schema itself is compliant with some minor field omissions, and referential integrity is maintained, but the conceptual content is fundamentally misaligned with source evidence. A complete reformulation replacing all 7 nodes with 6 new mathematics-focused nodes would accurately capture the actual source content about mathematical notation definition, type theory, and examples."

      "SOURCE CONTAINS ZERO MENTIONS: 'AI', 'safety', 'verification', 'error', 'ambiguity', 'problem', 'intervention', 'Coq', 'Lean', 'policy', 'formal proof', 'specification'—yet these are central to extracted graph.",
      "INVERTED LOGIC: Extraction frames colon-to notation as a 'solution' to specification ambiguity. Source does not identify specification errors as a problem. Source merely defines what the notation means. The notation is presented as standard mathematical communication, not as a fix.",
      "TEXTUAL EVIDENCE—What the source ACTUALLY contains: (1) Definition of notation: 'means that $f$ is a [function] with [domain] $X$ and [codomain] $Y$' (2) Connection to type theory: 'The use of a colon to express that a given value has a given type, as is done in type theory, is a generalization of this notation' (3) Two concrete examples: f : ℝ → ℝ (real-to-real) and f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ (Cartesian product) (4) Brief reference to Cartesian product sets. That is the complete informational content.",

Missing fields are: node_rationale, edge_rationale, intervention_lifecycle_rationale, intervention_maturity_rationale. These are MINOR field omissions but MAJOR conceptual issues are present (wrong domain, wrong causal direction).",
      "CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT: All edges marked confidence 2 ('Weak, single examples, preliminary results, limited case studies, or light inference'). This confidence level is appropriate for the actual inference applied, but the inference itself is unjustified by the source.",
      "RECOMMENDATION: REJECT ENTIRE EXTRACTION. Replace with 6-node mathematical knowledge graph capturing: (1) Colon-to notation definition, (2) Domain-codomain specification rationale, (3) Type theory generalization principle, (4) Real number example, (5) Cartesian product example, (6) Cartesian product set operation. This maintains source fidelity and enables valid merging across 500k sources by not hallucinating AI safety content in pure mathematics documents."
