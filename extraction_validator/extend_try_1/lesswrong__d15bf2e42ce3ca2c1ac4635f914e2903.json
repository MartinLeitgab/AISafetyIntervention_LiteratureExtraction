Additionally, edge directionality errors exist where validation evidence nodes incorrectly point backward to implementation mechanisms, and critical missing nodes diminish coverage (no node for 'Expert domain knowledge enables error detection', 'Genuine scientific disagreement', or 'Observed epistemic humility'). The core knowledge fabric structure is sound and will merge effectively once: (1) all missing rationale attributes are populated with DATA_SOURCE citations, (2) edge directions are corrected, (3) three missing concept nodes are added, and (4) node/edge embedding fields are removed. With these fixes applied, the graph becomes valid, mergeable, and traceable."

Example: 'Confident misinformation in AI-assisted technical Q&A' must include DATA_SOURCE citation to risk statement 'I think an AI which gives confident wrong answers to people who ask it about topics they themselves are not experts about is dangerous.'",
      "BLOCKER: All edges lack edge_rationale and edge_confidence_rationale attributes required by schema. Example: edge from 'Lack of epistemic calibration' to 'Epistemic calibration reduces user overtrust' should cite DATA_SOURCE observation that user persuasion differs by expertise.",
      "BLOCKER: All intervention nodes lack intervention_lifecycle_rationale and intervention_maturity_rationale. These must justify lifecycle stage (1-6) and maturity level (1-4) with DATA_SOURCE grounding.",
      "MAJOR: Edge directionality errors on two edges using 'validated_by' type. Implementation mechanism nodes should not have evidence pointing backward into them without post-intervention validation results. DATA_SOURCE provides problem evidence, not solution validation. These edges should reverse direction and use 'motivates' type instead.",
      "MAJOR: Missing node 'Expert domain knowledge enables error detection in AI outputs' - DATA_SOURCE explicitly contrasts: 'I felt quite persuaded by it when talking about physics. I could tell the information it gave me about C++ was inaccurate, though.' This is core evidence that expertise gates error detection.",
      "MAJOR: Missing node 'Genuine scientific disagreement on fundamental physics topics' - DATA_SOURCE states: 'a few things like air lift, kinetic vs static friction, osmosis, and the stuff listed in <https://xkcd.com/2682/> are somewhat controversial in that Wikipedia, Quora and stackexchange and other places provide various conflicting answers.' This context matters for understanding misinformation difficulty.",
      "MAJOR: Missing node 'Observed instances of appropriate epistemic humility in LLM responses' - DATA_SOURCE shows model stating: 'However, the exact mechanism by which paracetamol lowers body temperature is not well understood, and further research is needed.' This evidence that calibration is sometimes applied is missing and important.",
      "MINOR: All intervention nodes should be marked Maturity 1-2 (not 3-4) because DATA_SOURCE identifies problems but proposes no specific interventions. These are inferred solutions requiring edge_confidence 1-2 on supporting edges.",
      "MINOR: Embedding fields set to null across all nodes/edges should be removed if not used per schema requirements.",
      "COVERAGE: No edges connect the three main risk pathways (misinformation, software defects, expert knowledge gap) to validate they form a connected fabric. After adding missing nodes, all pathways should interconnect."
