JSON structure is valid but schema requirements unfulfilled. The node naming and categorization correctly decompose frameworks into components (e.g., counterfactual design vs implementation mechanism), and referential integrity is sound (no orphans or missing references). However, the graph fails to capture the full theoretical hierarchy showing uninfluenceable ⟹ unriggable relationship and misses edges connecting riggable analysis to sacrifice theorems. With proposed fixes applied (adding missing schema fields, 2 new concept nodes, and 2 new edges), the extraction becomes complete, valid, and mergeable across domains."
