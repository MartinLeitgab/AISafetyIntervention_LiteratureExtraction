    "summary": "The knowledge graph extraction demonstrates strong structural coverage of core reasoning pathways from AGI existential risks through theoretical insights to proposed interventions, with correct identification of three major causal-interventional threads (intelligence explosion microeconomics, Friendly AI alignment via TDT, expert cultivation for research). However, the submission has critical schema non-compliance issues (missing required rationale fields, extraneous 'embedding' attributes), several inference-weak edges requiring confidence level corrections, and one problematic node (Strategic mis-preparedness) that conflates preparedness with timeline forecasting. The fabric connectivity is sound but schema adherence is incomplete. After applying proposed fixes, the extraction would be valid and mergeable across data sources."

      "Referential integrity: All 28 edge source_node and target_node references match existing node names - no dangling references detected.",

One strategic implication from source is missing: 'Friendly AI project competitive advantage requirement' stated in 'MIRI's Mission' final strategic implication.",
      "Evidence strength corrections: Edge from 'Historical technological growth trends' to intervention marked confidence 2 but source only mentions evidence types (Moore's Law, hominid evolution, chess AI) without demonstrating actual ROI model constraint - should be confidence 1. Edge from 'Aggregation methods reduce prediction error' to DAGGRE intervention marked confidence 2 but source only references historical forecasting success without AGI timeline specifics - confidence 2 appropriate.",
      "Lifecycle/maturity corrections: Intervention 'Develop quantitative ROI models' has lifecycle 6 (Other) but should be 1 (Model Design) - source describes foundational theoretical research. Intervention 'Research TDT-based frameworks' has maturity 2 (Experimental) but should be 1 (Foundational) - Altair's paper is theoretical formulation without AGI validation. DAGGRE intervention has lifecycle 6 but should be 5 (Deployment) - described as active platform.",
      "Node semantic accuracy: 'Strategic mis-preparedness' node is inference from timeline forecasting discussion but source does not explicitly frame preparedness gaps as distinct problem - recommend merge with timeline uncertainty node to reflect actual source framing.",
      "Decomposition quality: Framework decomposition (e.g., Friendly AI broken into indirect normativity → TDT mechanism) follows specifications correctly - white box rather than black box treatment observed throughout."
