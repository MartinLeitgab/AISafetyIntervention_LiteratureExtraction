Summary  
Data source overview: The analyzed text is a review of Stuart Russell’s book “Human Compatible”, summarising the alignment research agenda it proposes (co-operative inverse reinforcement learning, reward uncertainty, modelling human irrationality, meta-preference learning, aggregate utilitarianism) and contrasting it with alternative ideas such as approval-directed agency. The reviewer also highlights several open technical problems (instrumental convergence, ontological pointer issues, fully-updated deference) and suggests that more robust design principles are needed.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: The post is non-technical and largely conceptual; therefore moderate inference (confidence 2–3) was required to translate narrative arguments into explicit causal nodes and to infer practical interventions (marked with low maturity).  
Extraction completeness: Every distinct claim that plays a role in the reasoning chains from existential risk to suggested design interventions was captured and linked, yielding 19 nodes and 25 edges with no isolated elements. All frameworks (CIRL, approval-directed agents) are decomposed into white-box components.  
Key limitations: 1) No empirical studies are cited in the text; validation evidence nodes therefore rely on conceptual demonstrations, so confidence is moderate. 2) Section headings in the blog are sparse; rationales use the nearest heading plus inline quotations. 3) Some implementation details (e.g., exact algorithms for dynamic feature addition) are inferred at high level.

Instruction-set improvement suggestions (brief):  
1. Provide a miniature example mapping showing how to handle purely conceptual sources lacking quantitative validation, clarifying expected confidence levels.  
2. Clarify whether “validation evidence” can include negative demonstrations (e.g., wire-heading examples) or must be positive empirical support.  
3. Allow an explicit field to flag nodes/edges created via moderate inference to aid downstream filtering.
