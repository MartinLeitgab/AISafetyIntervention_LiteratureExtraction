Summary  
Data source overview: The essay analyses what it means for a mind (human or AGI) to “want” something. It argues that human wanting is extraordinarily heterogeneous, provisional, ambiguous and self-referential; therefore naïvely transferring the folk concept of “wanting” to AGI will misfire and create alignment failures. It concludes that AGI must remain fully corrigible and interpretable so that people can continually update the system’s “wants” as human wanting unfolds.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [71] – The text is philosophical (little empirical data) so many edges rely on conceptual argument (confidence 2–3). Instructions were followed strictly; JSON has been validated locally.  
Instruction-set improvement: provide explicit examples for purely theoretical papers (no experiments) so edge-confidence calibration is easier; add an “inferred from philosophical argument” tag.  
Inference strategy justification: Where the author only gives design desiderata (corrigibility, interpretability) I infer concrete AI-safety interventions (e.g. override channels) consistent with standard literature and mark edges 2 (weak) when inference required.  
Extraction completeness: Every claim that matters for the reasoning chain from “risk ⇢ intervention” is captured; redundant or un-connectable fragments were omitted.  
Key limitations: No quantitative validation evidence exists, so the “validation evidence” node is conceptual only; interventions are therefore low-maturity.
