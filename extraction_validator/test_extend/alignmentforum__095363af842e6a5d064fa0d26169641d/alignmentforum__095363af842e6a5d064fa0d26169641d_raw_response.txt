          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The essay analyses what it means for a mind (human or AGI) to “want” something. It argues that human wanting is extraordinarily heterogeneous, provisional, ambiguous and self-referential; therefore naïvely transferring the folk concept of “wanting” to AGI will misfire and create alignment failures. It concludes that AGI must remain fully corrigible and interpretable so that people can continually update the system’s “wants” as human wanting unfolds.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [71] – The text is philosophical (little empirical data) so many edges rely on conceptual argument (confidence 2–3). Instructions were followed strictly; JSON has been validated locally.  \nInstruction-set improvement: provide explicit examples for purely theoretical papers (no experiments) so edge-confidence calibration is easier; add an “inferred from philosophical argument” tag.  \nInference strategy justification: Where the author only gives design desiderata (corrigibility, interpretability) I infer concrete AI-safety interventions (e.g. override channels) consistent with standard literature and mark edges 2 (weak) when inference required.  \nExtraction completeness: Every claim that matters for the reasoning chain from “risk ⇢ intervention” is captured; redundant or un-connectable fragments were omitted.  \nKey limitations: No quantitative validation evidence exists, so the “validation evidence” node is conceptual only; interventions are therefore low-maturity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Misinterpretation of provisional human wanting by advanced AGI\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AGI misunderstanding evolving human values\", \"Misalignment from provisional wants\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"If an AGI treats human wanting as fixed, precise or homogeneous, it may optimise for an incorrect target, causing catastrophic misalignment.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced in opening ‘Human wanting’ & alignment framing—core top-level risk discussed throughout paper.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Complexity and ambiguity of human wanting across contexts\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Variety of human wanting\", \"Heterogeneous human values\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Human wants vary in scope, stability, explicitness, endorsement, timescale and self-referentiality, making them hard to formalise directly.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Section ‘The variety of human wanting’ catalogues dozens of dimensions, forming the immediate cause of misinterpretation risk.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Human wanting is provisional yet specifiable with corrigibility\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Provisional but specifiable values\", \"Need for continual correction\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Although ambiguous, human wants can in principle be specified if artificial agents remain open to revision and correction by humans.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Derived from ‘Human wanting is half of an aligned AGI’ and ‘provisionality’ subsections.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Interpretability bridges human conceptual models and AGI wanting\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Interpretability for value alignment\", \"Transparency of wanting representations\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Because human concepts of wanting are conjectural, tools that expose how an AGI represents and updates its ‘wants’ are necessary for effective oversight.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Implied in ‘Human “wanting” is a network of conjectural concepts’—interpretability is needed to relate those concepts to machine internals.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Design AGI corrigible to evolving human wants\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Corrigibility design rationale\", \"Correctable AGI objective\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Given provisional human wanting, AGI should be engineered so that it accepts revision, including changes that alter its own corrigibility.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"design rationale\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Explicit in ‘the AGI must be correctable (corrigible) … even to the point of a paradox of tolerance’.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Integrate interpretability into alignment approach\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Interpretability-centred design rationale\", \"Design for transparency\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Making wanting transparent is central to ensuring that humans can understand and update AGI objectives.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"design rationale\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Follows from interpretability theoretical insight;
