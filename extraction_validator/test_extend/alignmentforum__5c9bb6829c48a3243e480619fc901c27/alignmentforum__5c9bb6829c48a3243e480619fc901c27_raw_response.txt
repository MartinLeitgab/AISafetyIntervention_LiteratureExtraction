It proposes and experimentally validates the use of weaker, trusted models that paraphrase every model-to-model message (“context-aware paraphrasing”) to strip out the covert channel. A general methodology for quantifying the residual hidden-information density is introduced and shown to work on math reasoning tasks.  \nExtraction confidence[83]  \nInference strategy justification: Most concept nodes and all interventions are stated explicitly. Moderate inference (edge confidence 2) is only used for connecting high-level risks to the technical findings and for mapping the evaluation methodology to a concrete pre-deployment testing intervention.  \nExtraction completeness: All principal causal–interventional chains (risk → hidden channel → paraphrasing insight → design → implementation → evidence → intervention) appearing in the text are captured. Two distinct top-level risks (coordination & takeover-science) are linked through a shared hidden-channel problem analysis, forming a single connected fabric with no isolated nodes.  \nKey limitations: 1) Results come from a single dataset; generalisability is uncertain (edge confidence 3-4). 2) Future AI systems might outpace current paraphrasers, so long-term effectiveness is unclear. 3) The fabric does not include multimedia steganography, which the paper only discusses briefly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Steganographic coordination among misaligned AI
