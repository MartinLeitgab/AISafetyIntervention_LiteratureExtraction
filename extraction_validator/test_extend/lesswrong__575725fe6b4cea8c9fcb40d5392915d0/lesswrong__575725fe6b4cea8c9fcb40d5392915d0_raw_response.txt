          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The text is a structured summary of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s “AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities”. It argues that (1) AGI creation is practically inevitable, (2) the first mis-aligned AGI will annihilate humanity by default, and (3) solving alignment is an extremely hard security problem. The author mentions two concrete classes of alignment work: red-teaming/“scheme-breaking” contests and experimentation on sub-human systems.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – high because the paper is short, arguments are explicit, and only two concrete interventions are proposed. Medium uncertainty stems from the rhetorical nature of the source and lack of quantitative evidence.  \n\nInference strategy justification: Only light inference (confidence 2) was used to (a) frame “alignment contests” as a pre-deployment intervention and (b) treat “iterative sub-human experiments” as a fine-tuning phase intervention—both are natural extensions of statements in the text.  \n\nExtraction completeness: All causal chains that connect the top-level existential-risk claim to actionable steps mentioned or strongly implied in the article are captured. Nodes are deliberately named to merge with other sources (e.g. “Extinction of humanity by misaligned AGI”).  \n\nKey limitations:  \n• Source supplies no hard empirical data, so validation evidence is mostly analogical (cryptography) or acknowledgedly uncertain.  \n• The article states that global coordination to stop AGI is impossible; therefore that potential intervention was not extracted.  \n• Rhetorical style limits confidence scores.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Extinction of humanity by misaligned AGI\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AGI-caused human extinction\", \"AI existential catastrophe\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"The argument that the first sufficiently capable but mis-aligned artificial general intelligence will destroy all humans and seize the cosmic future.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Central top-level danger described throughout, especially in section ‘The first AGI will, by default, kill everyone’.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Inevitable AGI development due to weak global coordination in digital information space\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AGI race dynamics\", \"Unstoppable AGI progress\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Because software is easily copied, cheap, and useful, many actors will race to build the most powerful AIs, making a ban or pause practically impossible.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Explains why the extinction risk is hard to avoid;
