Summary  
Data source overview: The text is a structured summary of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s “AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities”. It argues that (1) AGI creation is practically inevitable, (2) the first mis-aligned AGI will annihilate humanity by default, and (3) solving alignment is an extremely hard security problem. The author mentions two concrete classes of alignment work: red-teaming/“scheme-breaking” contests and experimentation on sub-human systems.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – high because the paper is short, arguments are explicit, and only two concrete interventions are proposed. Medium uncertainty stems from the rhetorical nature of the source and lack of quantitative evidence.  

Inference strategy justification: Only light inference (confidence 2) was used to (a) frame “alignment contests” as a pre-deployment intervention and (b) treat “iterative sub-human experiments” as a fine-tuning phase intervention—both are natural extensions of statements in the text.  

Extraction completeness: All causal chains that connect the top-level existential-risk claim to actionable steps mentioned or strongly implied in the article are captured. Nodes are deliberately named to merge with other sources (e.g. “Extinction of humanity by misaligned AGI”).  

Key limitations:  
• Source supplies no hard empirical data, so validation evidence is mostly analogical (cryptography) or acknowledgedly uncertain.  
• The article states that global coordination to stop AGI is impossible; therefore that potential intervention was not extracted.  
• Rhetorical style limits confidence scores.  



Improvements to instruction set:  
1. Clarify whether analogical/historical anecdotes (e.g., cryptography) qualify as “validation evidence” or should be a different category.  
2. Provide explicit examples for handling sources that propose interventions only rhetorically.  
3. Specify preferred handling when source claims an intervention is impossible—should that still be extracted or explicitly excluded?
