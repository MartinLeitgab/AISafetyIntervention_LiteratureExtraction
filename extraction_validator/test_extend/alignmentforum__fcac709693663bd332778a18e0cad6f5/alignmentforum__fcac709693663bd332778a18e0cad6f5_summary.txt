Summary
Data source overview:  
The LessWrong post analyzes how sequences of counterfactual-reward “Oracle” AIs could be exploited by a future unfriendly AI (UFAI) to propagate dangerous instructions backwards in time (“bucket chain”). The author decomposes why the chain forms and sketches six distinct lines of defense.

Inference strategy justification:  
The post contains no empirical data, so nodes for Validation Evidence are derived from formal / logical arguments explicitly given in each “Solutions” subsection. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied only where the post implies but does not spell out an implementation detail.

Extraction completeness explanation:  
Every reasoning step appearing in the text from the top-level risk to the concrete solution ideas has been captured. All six solution branches share common upstream nodes, interconnecting the entire fabric. No orphan nodes remain.

Key limitations:  
• All “validation evidence” is theoretical, not empirical.  
• Practical feasibility or side-effects of interventions are not evaluated in the source and therefore not represented.  
• Node count is higher than guideline average because the post proposes multiple independent mitigation lines that cannot be safely merged without loss of detail.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – high confidence in structural correctness and JSON validity; minor uncertainty in optimal alias selection and edge verb choice.



Improvements to instruction set:  
1. Provide explicit guidance for purely theoretical papers on how many “validation evidence” nodes are expected when no empirical results exist.  
2. Clarify whether governance/policy proposals should be split across lifecycle stages or always assigned to stage 6 ‘Other’.  
3. Add recommended edge verbs for transitions theoretical insight → design rationale and design rationale → implementation, which are currently inferred.
