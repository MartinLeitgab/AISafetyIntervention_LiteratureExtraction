Summary  
• Data‐source overview: The article introduces “feature visualization,” an interpretability technique that finds the input pattern that most strongly activates a neuron, channel, layer or class logit.  By visualising these patterns (e.g. DeepDream images of “dogs”), researchers can inspect what features a network has actually learned, thereby turning an otherwise opaque model into one whose internal representations are partially observable.  
• Extraction confidence[78]  
• Inference strategy: The paper is a short tutorial; it does not explicitly discuss “risks” or “interventions.”  Moderate inference (edge-confidence 1-2) was used only where the safety relevance is implicit: e.g. using the tool to audit models prior to deployment or to iteratively repair training data.  
• Extraction completeness: All statements that form a causal chain from the high-level safety risk (opaque decision making & spurious correlations) through problem analysis, theoretical insights, design rationale, implementation mechanism and validation evidence, down to two actionable interventions, are captured.  All nodes inter-connect and no node remains isolated.  
• Key limitations:  (i) Evidence is largely illustrative, not quantitative, so edge confidences are mostly 2-3.  (ii) Only the “feature-visualisation” technique is covered; broader interpretability methods are out of scope.  Future instructions could clarify how to treat very short sources that omit explicit titles (we used nearest text paragraph as reference).



Please let us know if any part of the instruction set could be clarified further to aid consistent extraction across very short tutorial-style sources like this one.
