          "text": "Data source overview  \nThe February 2023 Google blog post announces “Bard,” a lightweight LaMDA‐based conversational system, and describes upcoming AI-powered Search features, a Generative Language API, and Google’s ongoing AI Principles work.  The text emphasises quality, safety, groundedness, scalable user feedback, and provision of cloud compute and governance resources.\n\nReport EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77]  \nThe blog is short and mainly visionary, so many causal links are implicit.  I extracted all explicit safety-related reasoning and, where needed, used light inference (edge confidence = 2) to keep each path fully connected.  The JSON validates and all node names follow the required granularity rules.\n\nInference strategy justification  \nWhenever the article asserted intentions (e.g. gathering feedback from Bard testers) without empirical data, I inferred intermediate theoretical-design-implementation nodes that logically bridge the risk to the intervention, marking those edges confidence 2.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nAll three distinct safety themes—(1) scalable feedback for safe responses, (2) compute/tool access for trustworthy AI development, and (3) governance via AI Principles—are represented from top-level risks through to concrete interventions, sharing common nodes where relevant.  No isolated nodes remain.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Evidence for validation nodes is anecdotal, so uncertainties remain.  \n• The blog does not provide quantitative findings; future updates could enrich validation evidence nodes.  \n• Some section headings are absent; I referenced surrounding quotation text instead.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ungrounded or unsafe
