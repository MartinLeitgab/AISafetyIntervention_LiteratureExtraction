Summary  
Data source overview: The blog post summarizes the 2016 MIRI programme “Alignment for Advanced Machine-Learning Systems”.  It introduces eight concrete research problems aimed at reducing the risk of unintended, harmful behaviour from future powerful ML agents.  The post motivates each problem, sketches why it would mitigate specific failure modes, and connects the new agenda with previous safety work.  

Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: The article is a high-level agenda; it rarely provides implementation details or empirical results.  I therefore (a) decomposed each of the eight research topics into the causal-interventional chain requested, (b) supplied moderately-inferred but standard ML safety implementations (marked with edge confidence = 2) and (c) used the single explicitly cited surveys (Taylor et al. 2016; Amodei et al. 2016) as shared validation-evidence nodes.  

Extraction completeness explanation: All risks mentioned (unintended harmful behaviour, side effects, manipulation/deception) are represented.  Each of the eight research directions appears once as an implementation mechanism node, connected through its own design-rationale and theoretical-insight nodes to the relevant problem analyses and risks.  All paths are interconnected via shared risks, validation evidence and occasionally shared theoretical insights, so the graph forms one connected fabric without isolated nodes.  

Key limitations  
• Empirical evidence in the source is scant; validation nodes are therefore survey-level and receive low/medium confidence.  
• Some implementation details are inferred (confidence 2) because the agenda paper is largely conceptual.  
• To meet the ≈15-node target while still covering all eight problems, several closely related ideas (e.g. corrigibility vs. averting instrumental incentives) were merged.  Down-stream pipelines may want a finer split.  

Potential prompt improvements:  
1. Clarify whether a conceptual agenda with little empirical data must nevertheless include a “validation evidence” node (and what fits that role).  
2. Provide an explicit target range for nodes vs. words when the source is short.  
3. Allow an optional “conceptual proposal” node-type for papers that contain no experiments.  



MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST  
✓ No edge connects a risk node directly to an intervention node.  
✓ All pathways are interconnected via shared validation evidence and risk nodes – no isolated components.  
✓ Each node participates in ≥1 edge; no duplicates.  
✓ Agenda framework decomposed into explicit component nodes; no monolithic “alignment for ML” black box.  
✓ JSON syntax validated and all node names referenced in edges match exactly.
