Summary  
Data-source overview: The paper surveys modern macro-economic models that explore how advanced AI could transform output growth, wages and the labour share.  It catalogues mechanisms such as task automation, automated R&D, changes in saving behaviour and feedback loops that may create growth slow-downs or growth singularities.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]  
The textual paper is long and densely technical.  I am ≥ 70 % certain every explicit causal-interventional chain that links the central risks (wage stagnation, innovation slow-down, recursive growth overshoot, saving-induced recession) to at least one actionable mitigation is represented.  Remaining uncertainty stems from necessary condensation of >40 000 words into ≈25 nodes and the use of light inference to phrase policy-style interventions that the paper only recommends implicitly.  JSON schema has been validated by hand.

Instruction-set improvement: 1) Allow an “observed historical regularity” node-type; it prevents forcing all empirical facts into “validation evidence”. 2) Add an explicit “policy lever” field for interventions so fiscal / regulatory levers can be distinguished from technical ML interventions. 3) Provide examples for multi-risk fabrics sharing intermediate nodes.

Inference strategy justification  
Where the source discussed abstract “policy requirements” (e.g. ‘transfer from old to young’, ‘public research subsidies’) I instantiated them as concrete policy interventions and flagged maturity=2 (experimental) with confidence=2.  No speculative interventions beyond what an economist reader would infer were introduced.

Extraction completeness  
Four fully connected reasoning strands cover:  
• Labour-share collapse from task automation.  
• Innovation slow-down from AI-enabled imitation.  
• Growth singularity overshoot from automated research feedback.  
• Recession risk from saving-rate collapse after wage loss.  
All high-level mechanisms the paper labels “transformative” are thus present.

Key limitations  
• Micro-level ML safety techniques (interpretability, alignment) are out of scope for an economics paper; no such nodes are included.  
• Validation evidence relies on stylised models, not empirical trials, so confidence rarely exceeds 3.



Explanation of verification checklist  
✓ No intervention node is directly connected to any risk node.  
✓ All four causal fabrics are cross-connected through shared economic concepts (e.g. substitutability, saving behaviour) ensuring one connected graph; no isolated nodes.  
✓ Each node participates in ≥1 edge; duplicates removed.  
✓ No black-box framework nodes – each mechanism decomposed.  
✓ JSON validated for field names and edge lookup.
