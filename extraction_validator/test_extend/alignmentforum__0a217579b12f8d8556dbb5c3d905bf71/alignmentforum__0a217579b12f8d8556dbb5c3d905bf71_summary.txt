Summary  
Data source overview: The post reframes the “gradient hacking” threat in neural-network training, arguing that dangerous mesa-optimisers can only manipulate learning in three ways—(1) convergent (via malicious local minima), (2) non-convergent (exploiting optimiser inadequacies) or (3) non-stationary (in RL/continual-learning settings).  It surveys theoretical and empirical evidence on why each route may or may not succeed and sketches safety-motivated design principles such as enforcing provable convergence, keeping training objectives stationary and monitoring optimisation dynamics.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper is largely conceptual; where concrete interventions were implicit (e.g. “train to convergence”, “prefer stationary data”), I extracted them with light inference (edge confidence 2) and flagged this.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning chains from the top-level risk (“deceptive mesa-optimisation via gradient hacking”) through the three problem analyses, through theoretical insights, design rationales, concrete mechanisms, evidence, to six actionable interventions were captured and interconnected; no isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: (1) The post supplies limited quantitative evidence, so validation-evidence nodes rely on cited papers and qualitative claims; (2) Some interventions generalise standard ML practice and may appear obvious to practitioners; (3) Unknown future papers could refine taxonomy, requiring node merging.



Potential instruction-set improvement: Clarify how to assign edge types when multiple verbs seem suitable (e.g. “specified_by” vs “refined_by”); supplying a strict mapping table would improve consistency across 500 k extractions.
