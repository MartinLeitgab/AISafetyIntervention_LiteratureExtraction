Summary  
Data source overview: The blog post is MIRI’s qualitative 2013 operations review. It details how operational bottlenecks (limited processes, manual work, no metrics) impeded progress on Friendly-AI research and how MIRI addressed them through automation, delegation, and introduction of OKR/KPI experiments.  
EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: The post is management-focused, not technical AI safety research. I therefore treated “organizational effectiveness” as a precursor risk to AI-safety progress and mapped its causal chain to the concrete operational interventions described. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied only where connections were implicit (e.g., executive time ↔ research effectiveness).  
Extraction completeness explanation: All distinct causal concepts explicitly discussed (risk, two key problems, three theoretical insights, three design rationales, six concrete mechanisms, one shared validation evidence) and three actionable interventions were captured, giving 19 interconnected nodes—roughly one node per 150 words. No nodes remain isolated; every intervention is backed by evidence through the full six-step reasoning chain.  
Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence is largely qualitative, so edge confidence is medium. 2) Some implementation mechanisms share the same validation node, which may under-represent nuanced evidence. 3) Organisational interventions are marked lifecycle 6 (“Other”), which may need a dedicated taxonomy extension for organisational-level safety work.

How the instruction set could be improved:  
• Provide separate lifecycle codes for “Organisational/Program-level” interventions; current 6 = Other is imprecise.  
• Offer explicit guidance on treating meta-organisational risks that indirectly affect AI safety progress, clarifying acceptable inference degree.  
• Include examples showing how to aggregate many small but related implementation mechanisms (e.g., multiple SaaS tools) into a single higher-level node to avoid node explosion.
