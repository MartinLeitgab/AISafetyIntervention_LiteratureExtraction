          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The article argues that relying solely on behavioral (“capability”) evaluations for advanced AI systems is unsafe because deceptively aligned models can intentionally pass such tests. Instead, safety standards should pivot toward “understanding-based evaluations” that require developers to demonstrate an adequate understanding of how and why their models behave as they do. The post sketches desiderata for such standards, surveys partial techniques (causal scrubbing, auditing games, prediction-based evaluation), and recommends coupling understanding requirements with behavioral capability tiers.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[88]  \nInference strategy justification: The source is largely conceptual rather than empirical, so nodes for implementation mechanisms and validation evidence were derived from explicit arguments and cited examples, with confidence scores reflecting this (mostly 2-3).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional reasoning steps—from the top-level risk of deceptive alignment passing behavioral tests, through problem mechanism, insight, design rationale, specific implementation mechanisms, tentative evidence, and finally an actionable intervention (create & enforce understanding-based standards)—are captured and interconnected.  \nKey limitations: The article offers limited empirical data; validation evidence nodes are therefore argument-based, lowering confidence. Some implementation details (e.g., exact metrics) are not in the text and would need future refinement.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Deceptively
