Summary
Data source overview: The paper proposes Language-Conditioned Reward Learning (LC-RL), a method that converts free-form language instructions into reward functions via multi-task Maximum-Entropy IRL in simulated indoor environments with known dynamics. Learned reward networks are then re-optimised with standard RL in unseen houses, outperforming policy-learning and GAIL baselines.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]
The paper is technical and clearly states all causal links, so nodes and edges could be extracted with high reliability. Small residual uncertainty stems from interpreting AI-safety-relevant “risks” that are only implicit in the paper.

Inference strategy justification
Moderate inference (edge confidence = 2) was used only
• to abstract the AI-safety risk (“incorrect task execution…”) the authors implicitly target and  
• to include the exploration-related shaping pathway that is suggested but not emphasised.

Extraction completeness explanation
All reasoning steps—from risks, through problem causes, insights, design rationales, implementations, validations, to the two actionable interventions—are captured and interconnected; framework components (LC-RL) are fully decomposed. No duplicate or isolated nodes remain.

Key limitations
• The original work is robotics-focused; some AI-safety generalisations are inferential.  
• Deployment-phase hazards (e.g., deceptive language) are outside the paper’s scope and thus not represented.  
• Empirical evidence strength is taken from reported success rates without access to statistical significance tests.
