Learned reward networks are then re-optimised with standard RL in unseen houses, outperforming policy-learning and GAIL baselines.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]\nThe paper is technical and clearly states all causal links, so nodes and edges could be extracted with high reliability. Small residual uncertainty stems from interpreting AI-safety-relevant “risks” that are only implicit in the paper.\n\nInference strategy justification\nModerate inference (edge confidence = 2) was used only\n• to abstract the AI-safety risk (“incorrect task execution…”) the authors implicitly target and  \n• to include the exploration-related shaping pathway that is suggested but not emphasised.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation\nAll reasoning steps—from risks, through problem causes, insights, design rationales, implementations, validations, to the two actionable interventions—are captured and interconnected; framework components (LC-RL) are fully decomposed. No duplicate or isolated nodes remain.\n\nKey limitations\n• The original work is robotics-focused; some AI-safety generalisations are inferential.  \n• Deployment-phase hazards (e.g., deceptive language) are outside the paper’s scope and thus not represented.  \n• Empirical evidence strength is taken from reported success rates without access to statistical significance tests.\n\nJSON
