Summary  
Data source overview: The paper presents a formal, model-based method for building and maintaining computer-integrated-manufacturing (CIM) Decision Support Systems (DSS) that capture and operationalise dispersed human know-how. It introduces a multi-sorted algebra / higher-order-logic formalism, a global Internet-accessible domain model, and a modular software environment (Scale System Builder, Ontology Builder, Fact Master, Validation & Verification tools, Feedback Analyzer). A prototype DSS that selects end-milling parameters from 47 empirical rules validates the approach.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86] – High confidence that nodes/edges follow all instructions and JSON is syntactically correct; moderate residual uncertainty around ideal edge verb choice granularity.

Instruction-set improvement: Allow an optional “sub-category” field for design-stage artefacts (e.g. “software architecture”) to minimise ambiguity between “design rationale” and “implementation mechanism”. Providing a canonical list of acceptable edge verbs with strict definitions would further harmonise the 500 k-source graph.

Inference strategy justification: Moderate inference (edge confidence 2) used only where the text implied but did not state links (e.g. that the prototype’s success motivates wider deployment). All interventions derive directly from mechanisms and evidence described in Sections 5–7.

Extraction completeness: 19 tightly-connected nodes (~1 per 250 words) cover every step from three top-level risks through problem mechanisms, insights, design arguments, implementation details, empirical validation and four actionable interventions. All nodes share at least one edge; no satellites.

Key limitations: 1) Prototype evaluation is single-case—edge confidences kept at 3–4 rather than 5. 2) Paper focuses on manufacturing, so safety relevance is indirect; interventions framed for knowledge-management analogue. 3) Some conceptual overlap between nodes 9 & 10 tolerated to maintain white-box granularity.
