Summary
Data source overview: The paper proposes LanguagE-Action Reward Network (LEARN), a framework that converts free-form natural-language instructions into potential-based shaping rewards for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents. Experiments on Montezuma’s Revenge show substantially faster and better learning compared with sparse-reward baselines.

Inference strategy justification: The paper explicitly presents a causal chain from problems with sparse/expert-built rewards through the idea of language-based shaping, its concrete neural implementation, and experimental validation that motivates two concrete actionable interventions (dataset collection + shaped–reward training). All nodes and edges are extracted following the specified six-stage causal-interventional order; modest inference (edge confidence = 2) is only used where the paper implicitly links steps (e.g. that dataset collection is a prerequisite).

Extraction completeness explanation: 18 concept nodes capture every distinct claim necessary for the end-to-end reasoning path, and two intervention nodes exhaust all actionable steps discussed or implied. All nodes inter-connect into one fabric; no isolated nodes remain.

Key limitations: (1) The source focuses on one domain (Montezuma’s Revenge), so external validity is limited. (2) Only action-frequency features are used, so state-grounding limitations are noted but not yet an intervention. (3) Moderate inference was needed to map dataset collection to a standalone intervention.

Instruction-set improvement suggestions
1. Distinguish clearly when “required_by” vs. “enabled_by” should be used; examples differ across documents.
2. Provide guidance on handling multiple validation evidences pointing to different intervention stages.
3. Clarify whether edges from validation evidence to earlier-stage interventions (e.g. data-collection) are acceptable or if only final interventions should be endpoints.
