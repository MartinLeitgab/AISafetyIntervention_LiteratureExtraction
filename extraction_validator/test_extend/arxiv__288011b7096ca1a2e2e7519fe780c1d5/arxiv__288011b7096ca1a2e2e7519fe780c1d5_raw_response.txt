          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The paper proposes LanguagE-Action Reward Network (LEARN), a framework that converts free-form natural-language instructions into potential-based shaping rewards for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents. Experiments on Montezuma’s Revenge show substantially faster and better learning compared with sparse-reward baselines.\n\nInference strategy justification: The paper explicitly presents a causal chain from problems with sparse/expert-built rewards through the idea of language-based shaping, its concrete neural implementation, and experimental validation that motivates two concrete actionable interventions (dataset collection + shaped–reward training). All nodes and edges are extracted following the specified six-stage causal-interventional order; modest inference (edge confidence = 2) is only used where the paper implicitly links steps (e.g. that dataset collection is a prerequisite).\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: 18 concept nodes capture every distinct claim necessary for the end-to-end reasoning path, and two intervention nodes exhaust all actionable steps discussed or implied. All nodes inter-connect into one fabric; no isolated nodes remain.\n\nKey limitations: (1) The source focuses on one domain (Montezuma’s Revenge), so external validity is limited. (2) Only action-frequency features are used, so state-grounding limitations are noted but not yet an intervention. (3) Moderate inference was needed to map dataset collection to a standalone intervention.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\":
