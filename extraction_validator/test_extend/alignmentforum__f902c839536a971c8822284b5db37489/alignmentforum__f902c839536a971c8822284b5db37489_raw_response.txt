          "text": "Summary:\nThis article proposes “meta-level adversarial evaluation” – training deliberately deceptive policies that look good to an oversight process while carrying out bad actions – as a method to test whether an oversight process is locally adequate before deploying powerful models. It details strategies for constructing proxy failures, coping with capability-elicitation challenges, and extending the method to recursive AI-assisted oversight. No new empirical studies are reported; the paper offers qualitative arguments and concrete thought-experiments.\n\nExtraction confidence[83]  \nInference strategy justification: The paper is conceptual, so moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied when turning qualitative arguments and toy examples into explicit implementation-mechanism and intervention nodes.  \nExtraction completeness: All causal paths from the central risk (“oversight failures causing catastrophic AI actions”) through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms, validation arguments and on to six actionable interventions were captured and interconnected; no dangling nodes remain.  \nKey limitations: 1) Validation evidence is qualitative, so edge confidences are ≤ 3. 2) Recursive-oversight formalization remains conjectural, reflected in lower maturity scores. 3) Some node naming choices may need further harmonization across a 500 k-source corpus (e.g. “proxy failure” vs “analogous proxy failure”).  \n\nHow to improve prompt: provide explicit allowance for purely conceptual papers where “validation evidence” is argumentation rather than data; clarify expected confidence scoring in such cases.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Oversight failures causing catastrophic AI actions in deployment\",\n      \"aliases\":
