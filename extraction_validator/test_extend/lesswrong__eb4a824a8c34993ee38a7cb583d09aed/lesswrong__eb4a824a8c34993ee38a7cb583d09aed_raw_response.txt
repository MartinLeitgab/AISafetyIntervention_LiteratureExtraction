          "text": "Summary  \nThe post analyses whether RLHF training is responsible for “mode collapse”—very low-entropy, over-confident outputs—in OpenAI language models. Replicating earlier prompts, the authors find that supervised fine-tuning (text-davinci-002) collapses much more than the RLHF model (text-davinci-003). They theorise that RLHF’s KL-divergence penalty keeps entropy close to the base model’s and suggest using KL or entropy regularisation as well as pre-deployment entropy tests as mitigations.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  \nThe source is short and explicit about causal relations; paths from risk to interventions are clear. Ambiguities (e.g., exact algorithmic details) were marked as lower-confidence edges.  \n\nHow the instruction set could be improved  \n• Allow an explicit “detection/monitoring” concept category; forcing these into theoretical/design nodes required work-arounds.  \n• Provide examples of branching fabrics so users can see multiple interventions sharing upstream nodes.  \n• Clarify whether “motivates” may connect any upstream concept node to an intervention or only validation evidence.\n\nInference strategy justification  \nIntervention B (entropy bonus in RLHF) and the calibration test suite were not stated verbatim but are strongly implied by the theory and evidence; they were included with confidence level 2 and maturity 1–2.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nAll reasoning chains in the post—(1) KL regularisation prevents collapse, (2) entropy bonus methods can further help, (3) prompt-based entropy measurement can detect collapse—are represented from risk through intermediate concepts to interventions. Nodes were split to atomic yet merge-able granularity and all are connected.\n\nKey limitations  \n• The paper is informal; quantitative data is sparse, so edge confidences are mostly medium.  \n• Implementation details of RLHF with KL are high-level; deeper mechanistic nodes are not available.  \n• Only text-based entropy prompts were considered; other modalities are out of scope.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Mode collapse (low output entropy) in large language models\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"output entropy collapse in LLMs\", \"overconfident
