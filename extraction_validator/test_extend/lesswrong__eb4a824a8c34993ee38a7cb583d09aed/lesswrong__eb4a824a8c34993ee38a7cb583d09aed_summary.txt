Summary  
The post analyses whether RLHF training is responsible for “mode collapse”—very low-entropy, over-confident outputs—in OpenAI language models. Replicating earlier prompts, the authors find that supervised fine-tuning (text-davinci-002) collapses much more than the RLHF model (text-davinci-003). They theorise that RLHF’s KL-divergence penalty keeps entropy close to the base model’s and suggest using KL or entropy regularisation as well as pre-deployment entropy tests as mitigations.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
The source is short and explicit about causal relations; paths from risk to interventions are clear. Ambiguities (e.g., exact algorithmic details) were marked as lower-confidence edges.  

How the instruction set could be improved  
• Allow an explicit “detection/monitoring” concept category; forcing these into theoretical/design nodes required work-arounds.  
• Provide examples of branching fabrics so users can see multiple interventions sharing upstream nodes.  
• Clarify whether “motivates” may connect any upstream concept node to an intervention or only validation evidence.

Inference strategy justification  
Intervention B (entropy bonus in RLHF) and the calibration test suite were not stated verbatim but are strongly implied by the theory and evidence; they were included with confidence level 2 and maturity 1–2.

Extraction completeness explanation  
All reasoning chains in the post—(1) KL regularisation prevents collapse, (2) entropy bonus methods can further help, (3) prompt-based entropy measurement can detect collapse—are represented from risk through intermediate concepts to interventions. Nodes were split to atomic yet merge-able granularity and all are connected.

Key limitations  
• The paper is informal; quantitative data is sparse, so edge confidences are mostly medium.  
• Implementation details of RLHF with KL are high-level; deeper mechanistic nodes are not available.  
• Only text-based entropy prompts were considered; other modalities are out of scope.
