Summary  
The short forum post reports an unsuccessful personal attempt to assign precise numeric utilities to life outcomes. The author’s difficulty highlights a wider alignment-relevant concern: human preferences may not be well captured by single-number utilities, threatening any AI system that relies on such utilities for reward specification. The post supplies anecdotal evidence and implicitly motivates alternative preference-elicitation approaches that respect incomparability and context.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[78]  
• The data source is brief and largely anecdotal, so several links are supported only weakly; confidence is reduced accordingly.  
• Fabric obeys all structural rules and retains all reasoning expressed in the text.  
Instruction-set improvement: provide an explicit mapping from allowed edge types to the most common semantic relations (“X addresses Y” vs “Y addressed_by X”) to reduce ambiguity when deciding edge directionality.

Inference strategy justification  
Because no explicit interventions for AI alignment are proposed, moderate inference (edge confidence 2) was applied to derive the most natural AI-safety intervention: replacing numeric utility specification with partial-order preference learning during reward-model training, a technique already explored in RLHF literature.

Extraction completeness explanation  
All unique claims that form a causal chain from a top-level risk to an actionable intervention were extracted. No additional unique concepts were present in the short text, so the fabric is complete and fully connected.

Key limitations  
• Evidence is purely anecdotal, so validation strength is low.  
• Only one intervention could be credibly inferred; richer technical texts would yield larger fabrics.
