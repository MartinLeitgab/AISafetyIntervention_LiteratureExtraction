          "text": "Summary  \nThe short forum post reports an unsuccessful personal attempt to assign precise numeric utilities to life outcomes. The author’s difficulty highlights a wider alignment-relevant concern: human preferences may not be well captured by single-number utilities, threatening any AI system that relies on such utilities for reward specification. The post supplies anecdotal evidence and implicitly motivates alternative preference-elicitation approaches that respect incomparability and context.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[78]  \n• The data source is brief and largely anecdotal, so several links are supported only weakly; confidence is reduced accordingly.  \n• Fabric obeys all structural rules and retains all reasoning expressed in the text.  \nInstruction-set improvement: provide an explicit mapping from allowed edge types to the most common semantic relations (“X addresses Y” vs “Y addressed_by X”) to reduce ambiguity when deciding edge directionality.\n\nInference strategy justification  \nBecause no explicit interventions for AI alignment are proposed, moderate inference (edge confidence 2) was applied to derive the most natural AI-safety intervention: replacing numeric utility specification with partial-order preference learning during reward-model training, a technique already explored in RLHF literature.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nAll unique claims that form a causal chain from a top-level risk to an actionable intervention were extracted. No additional unique concepts were present in the short text, so the fabric is complete and fully connected.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Evidence is purely anecdotal, so validation strength is low.  \n• Only one intervention could be credibly inferred; richer technical texts would yield larger fabrics.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Value misalignment in AI systems from inaccurate utility modelling of human preferences\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"utility function misalignment in AI\", \"incorrect scalar utility for humans in AI alignment\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that AI systems optimized against a mis-specified scalar utility function will pursue goals that diverge from genuine human values because the utility model fails to reflect real human preferences.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Central AI-safety risk implicit in the post’s reflection on failed utility assignment (Main post).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cardinal utility representation failure for diverse human preferences\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"difficulty assigning numeric utilities\", \"failure of precise utility numbers for varied outcomes\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Problem that many human outcomes across life domains cannot be placed on a single cardinal utility scale, producing incomparabilities and intransitivities.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Author’s attempt to create a numeric utility list failed, revealing this problem (Main post).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Human preferences exhibit incomparability and context dependence\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"intransitive human preferences\", \"context-dependent preference structures\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Theoretical insight that people often cannot rank dissimilar outcomes or maintain consistent trade-offs;
