Summary  
Data source overview: The article (Cold Takes, Dec 2022, Holden Karnofsky) surveys the central catastrophic risks from transformative AI (mis-alignment, power imbalances, malicious misuse, capability races) and maps a suite of approaches—alignment research, global standards, strong security, threat-assessment, “careful” AI companies, forecasting, etc.—to concrete career tracks and organisational initiatives that can reduce those risks.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [83]  
Inference strategy justification: The article is largely conceptual and programmatic, so nodes for validation evidence and implementation had to draw on the few concrete examples the author cites (e.g. early deception benchmarks, Google 2018 principles) and on clearly-flagged proposals. Where information was extrapolated (e.g. zero-trust specifics) we labelled confidence “2” and marked the inference.  

Extraction completeness explanation: Every distinct reasoning chain that the article presents from top-level risk to actionable lever is represented. Seven interventions cover all job/initiative families singled out by the author; shared nodes interlink the fabric, eliminating isolates.  

Key limitations: 1) empirical evidence is thin, producing medium/weak confidence levels; 2) design/implementation details are necessarily generic compared with a technical paper; 3) some section titles repeat, complicating pinpoint referencing.



Extraction confidence can be improved by: 1) providing explicit mapping guidance for cases where theoretical insights do not directly “mitigate” problems but rather explicate them; clarifying preferred edge verbs for those situations would reduce ambiguity; 2) supplying a short list of acceptable moderate-inference templates could standardise confidence scoring; 3) including examples of how to reference section titles when the article uses repeated or nested headings would aid precision.
