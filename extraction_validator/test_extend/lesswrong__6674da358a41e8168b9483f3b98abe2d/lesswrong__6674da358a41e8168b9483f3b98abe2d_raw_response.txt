          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The article informally explores the idea of building a large-scale, Stack-Overflow-like platform (“Fact Overflow”) for factored cognition, a methodology Ought investigates for AI alignment. It lists potential benefits—tighter feedback loops and abundant training data—and rough feasibility estimates for development time and required user base.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77]  \nInference strategy justification: The paper is largely speculative; explicit causal language is sparse. I followed the prompt’s moderate-inference policy (edge confidence ≤ 2) to connect stated benefits, feasibility estimates, and the implied intervention.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: Every distinct claim that forms a reasoning chain from the top-level research risk to the concrete proposed intervention is captured. No isolated nodes remain, and node names were chosen to merge well across sources.  \nKey limitations: 1) No empirical validation exists; validation evidence is only feasibility modelling, so confidence levels are low. 2) The article does not detail technical implementation, limiting granularity of implementation-mechanism nodes. 3) Risk framing had to be inferred from context (the author’s alignment motivation).\n\nHow to improve the instruction set: 1) Clarify handling of purely speculative or feasibility-focused papers lacking empirical validation—e.g., allow “feasibility evidence” as a sub-category of validation evidence. 2) Provide guidance on selecting the most suitable intervention lifecycle code for research-infrastructure proposals that precede any ML pipeline stage. 3) Offer more examples of acceptable edge verb choices between problem analysis and theoretical insight nodes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Slow progress in factored cognition research for AI alignment\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"insufficient advancement of factored cognition\", \"lagging factored cognition progress\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Difficulty in developing factored cognition techniques quickly enough to contribute to AI alignment efforts, risking misaligned AI systems.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Sets the overall motivation;
