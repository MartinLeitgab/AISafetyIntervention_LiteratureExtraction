Summary  
Data source overview: The post gives a conceptual analysis of Goodhart’s Curse, describing three mechanisms (regression to the mean, optimization-induced correlation decay, and adversarial correlation) that explain why maximizing a proxy objective can systematically diverge from the true objective. Although no concrete engineering prescriptions are offered, the text strongly motivates several families of AI-safety interventions that limit optimization pressure, use robust statistics, or apply adversarial detection.  
EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84] – fairly high, because the source is short, purely theoretical, and the extracted fabric is compact.  
Inference strategy justification: The paper provides risks and problem analyses explicitly, but gives no implementations or empirical studies. Moderate, clearly-flagged inference (confidence 1-2 edges) was therefore applied to map commonly accepted AI-safety techniques (quantilization, robust aggregation, red-teaming) that directly answer the highlighted problems.  
Extraction completeness explanation: Every distinct reasoning element in the post (three Goodhart levels plus general divergence claim) is represented. Each is linked through theoretical insights to three design rationales, mechanisms, validation placeholders, and actionable interventions, forming one connected fabric with no dangling nodes.  
Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence nodes are hypothetical because the post is theory-only. 2) The interventions are inferred rather than stated. 3) Edge confidences are limited to medium/low because of the speculative nature of the source.



Improvement suggestions for the instruction set:  
1. Allow an explicit flag for “no validation evidence present” so hypothetical evidence nodes are unnecessary.  
2. Provide examples for mapping purely theoretical papers (common in AI safety) to interventions, to clarify expected inference scope.  
3. Clarify whether multiple parallel pathways (as used here) can share a single combined validation evidence node when the source lacks data.
