Summary
Data source overview: The post explains how the Long-Term Future Fund (LTFF) sets its grant-making bar, the fictitious projects it would fund at different fundraising levels, and the rationale for publishing this information to potential donors. It also describes LTFF’s adaptive threshold policy and Open Philanthropy’s 2:1 matching scheme.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]  
Instruction-set improvement: The template is heavily geared toward technical research papers. When the source is organisational or policy-oriented (as here), many required node categories (e.g., validation evidence) appear only implicitly. Allowing an “organisational evidence” subtype or relaxing the requirement that every path include all six concept categories when a category is not represented would reduce forced weak-confidence inferences.

Inference strategy justification: The paper contains no novel empirical studies, so moderate inference was required to (1) treat LTFF’s fundraising transparency and adaptive threshold as safety-relevant interventions and (2) extract implicit causal reasoning linking donor behaviour to funding and, ultimately, to catastrophic-risk mitigation. These inferences are flagged with confidence 1–2 edges.

Extraction completeness: All explicit causal chains (underfunding → donor behaviour → transparency intervention; and misallocation → variable donations → adaptive threshold) are captured, sharing the same validation evidence node, producing an interconnected fabric with 14 nodes and 13 edges. No isolated nodes remain.

Key limitations:  
• Validation evidence is weak and mostly correlational; confidence levels are therefore low.  
• Some node names are organisation-specific; future sources may warrant further generalisation.  
• The interventions are organisational processes rather than direct technical AI-safety methods, so downstream effectiveness modelling may require different metrics.
