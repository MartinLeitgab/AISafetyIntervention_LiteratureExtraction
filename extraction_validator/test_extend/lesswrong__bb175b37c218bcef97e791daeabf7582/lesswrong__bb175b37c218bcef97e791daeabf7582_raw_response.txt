          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: A user reports personal experiments with GPT-4 on several strategic games. While GPT-4 plays normal chess well, it routinely fails at Hex, Connect-4, logical‐constraint puzzles, and a chess variant with a different win condition, suggesting GPT-4 memorises narrow heuristics rather than possessing general strategic reasoning.  \nReport EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [77] – Medium-high: the text is short and informal, so the causal chains are necessarily coarse and partly inferred, but all explicit claims are captured and linked through a single connected knowledge fabric following the required template.  \nInference strategy justification: Because the post offers no explicit interventions, moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to derive two safety-relevant interventions that naturally follow from the author’s observations: (a) create robust pre-deployment evaluation suites for novel strategic tasks, and (b) augment LLMs with explicit search algorithms. Both are standard AI-safety responses to capability-misestimation risks.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All distinct claims about GPT-4’s strengths, failures, hypothesised mechanism (“rudimentary chess engine”), and their implications have been converted into eleven nodes (well within the 15/5k-word guideline) and connected by 12 edges, with no isolated nodes.  \nKey limitations: Evidence is anecdotal; edge confidences are therefore low. The post does not provide implementation detail for interventions, limiting maturity assessment. Future instructions could clarify how to treat purely anecdotal sources when constructing validation evidence nodes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Misgeneralization of language model strategic reasoning in deployment\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"LLM strategic reasoning misgeneralization risk\", \"Overestimation of GPT-4 planning ability\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that language models exhibit strong performance on familiar games like standard chess but fail catastrophically when objectives or games change, leading to unexpected task failure in real-world deployments requiring strategic reasoning.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Captures the top-level danger highlighted by the source text that GPT-4’s apparent competence may not transfer.
