Summary  
Data source overview: A user reports personal experiments with GPT-4 on several strategic games. While GPT-4 plays normal chess well, it routinely fails at Hex, Connect-4, logical‐constraint puzzles, and a chess variant with a different win condition, suggesting GPT-4 memorises narrow heuristics rather than possessing general strategic reasoning.  
Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [77] – Medium-high: the text is short and informal, so the causal chains are necessarily coarse and partly inferred, but all explicit claims are captured and linked through a single connected knowledge fabric following the required template.  
Inference strategy justification: Because the post offers no explicit interventions, moderate inference (confidence 2) was used to derive two safety-relevant interventions that naturally follow from the author’s observations: (a) create robust pre-deployment evaluation suites for novel strategic tasks, and (b) augment LLMs with explicit search algorithms. Both are standard AI-safety responses to capability-misestimation risks.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All distinct claims about GPT-4’s strengths, failures, hypothesised mechanism (“rudimentary chess engine”), and their implications have been converted into eleven nodes (well within the 15/5k-word guideline) and connected by 12 edges, with no isolated nodes.  
Key limitations: Evidence is anecdotal; edge confidences are therefore low. The post does not provide implementation detail for interventions, limiting maturity assessment. Future instructions could clarify how to treat purely anecdotal sources when constructing validation evidence nodes.



Potential instruction-set improvement: Supply explicit guidance on how to treat purely anecdotal evidence versus formal studies, perhaps mandating a separate “anecdotal evidence” node type or clearer rules for assigning edge-confidence scores below 3.
