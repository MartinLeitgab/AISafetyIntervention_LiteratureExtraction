          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The article proposes setting up a large “Early Warning Forecasting Center” that continuously produces accurate, private, short-range forecasts on bio- and AI-related early-warning indicators so that effective-altruist (EA) decision-makers can respond to existential threats with weeks of lead-time. The post provides arguments, analogies to hedge funds, organisational design details (cold/signal/hot teams, OSINT, crisis-response add-ons, possible government housing) and cites existing forecasting evidence.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83] – I am reasonably confident the JSON complies with all structural rules, every node is connected and edges follow the required risk→…→intervention flow. Remaining uncertainty stems from subjective categorisation of some design details and limited explicit empirical evidence in the source.  \nInference strategy justification: Where the paper offered proposals but not formal experiments, I added moderate-inference validation nodes (confidence 2) from real-world analogies it explicitly referenced (e.g. epidemic forecasting, UK superforecasting).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All distinct causal-interventional reasoning chains (pandemic-risk path, AI-risk path, OSINT/crisis-response/government variants) are represented; framework components are decomposed; no isolated nodes remain. Approximately 20 nodes ≈ one every 260 words, in line with guidance.  \nKey limitations: 1) Validation evidence is weak/anecdotal, so edge confidences are mostly 2-3. 2) Interventions are still theoretical; lifecycle/maturity assignments are necessarily low. 3) Some concepts (e.g. “firm vs market structure”) might overlap with other sources—future ontology work may further canonicalise names.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Human extinction from engineered pandemic\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"global catastrophic pandemic\", \"existential pandemic risk\"],\n

preferred concept categories could streamline categorisation decisions. Clarifying whether institution-building interventions always fall under lifecycle 6 would further reduce ambiguity."
