Summary  
The paper proposes “Partial Simulation Extrapolation” (PSE), a two-model gating architecture where a smaller “partial simulator” runs a low-complexity/fragmented version of a requested simulation and infers whether running the full simulation in a more powerful model is safe. PSE is offered as a way to cut specific outer-alignment risks that arise when large simulators predict or create misaligned agents.

Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77]  
The fabric links every stated chain of reasoning from the top-level risk (“outer alignment failure via mis-simulated agents”) through mechanism, hypotheses, design ideas, implementation details and conceptual evidence to three actionable interventions (deploy PSE gating, run fragmented simulations, run low-fidelity simulations). Edges follow the mandated order and are mutually connected; no orphan nodes remain and framework elements are decomposed. Confidence is moderate-high because the source is theoretical and lacks empirical data, so several edge confidences are necessarily “2–3”.

How the instruction set could be improved  
• Allow an explicit “conceptual argument” evidence strength category to distinguish purely theoretical validations from empirical ones.  
• Provide a recommended edge verb list for links between problem analysis → theoretical insight (e.g. “suggests”, “framed_by”) to reduce ambiguity.  
• Clarify whether multiple interventions derived from the same implementation mechanism should each receive separate validation edges or can share one.  
• Add guidance on handling proposals that are entirely prospective with no experiments (common in alignment literature).

Inference strategy justification  
The paper is purely propositional; no experiments exist. Moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to (i) assume GPT-4-level evaluation counts as validation evidence, and (ii) convert the high-level idea “use fragmented or low-fidelity simulation” into distinct deployable interventions.

Extraction completeness explanation  
All unique reasoning elements that participate in the causal pathway from the stated risk to the proposed mitigation have been captured as distinct, merge-friendly nodes (15 concept nodes ≈ adequate density for ~4500 words). The PSE framework was decomposed into gating rationale, pipeline mechanism, and two complexity-reduction sub-mechanisms. All are connected into a single fabric.

Key limitations  
• Evidence nodes are conceptual, not empirical; downstream effectiveness estimates will need external data.  
• The partial simulator security argument is speculative; edge confidence was therefore capped at 2.  
• The paper references earlier work (Cartesian frames) but details were not included; those will need separate extraction.
