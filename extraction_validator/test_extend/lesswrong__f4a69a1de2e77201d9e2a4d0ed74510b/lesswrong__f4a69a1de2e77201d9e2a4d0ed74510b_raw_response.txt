          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The blog-post presents a toy Monte-Carlo life-trajectory model that combines (1) actuarial mortality tables, (2) a Metaculus-based distribution over AGI arrival, (3) a time-dependent probability of global catastrophe from misaligned AGI, and (4) chances of curing biological aging once AGI exists.  The author finds the dominant outcomes for a person born in 2001 are “die from AGI” (35 %) or “survive AGI and see aging cured” (43 %).  They discuss which personal and societal actions move probability mass between outcomes, concluding that (i) working on AI safety, (ii) adopting healthy-living habits, and (iii) possibly slowing AGI are the most plausible interventions.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]\n\nInference strategy justification:  The post is qualitative; it names actions but does not formalise complete causal chains.  Moderate inference (edge-confidence 2) was therefore used to create explicit intermediate nodes (e.g. “Insufficient AI safety research…”) so that every path flows Risk → … → Intervention without skipping required categories.\n\nExtraction completeness:  All explicit risks (AI-induced extinction, dying before AGI) and all distinct interventions the author analyses (AI-safety work, healthy living, slowing AGI) are traced through the six intermediate concept categories.  The single validation evidence node (“Monte-Carlo model estimates…”) links every pathway, guaranteeing a connected knowledge fabric with no isolated nodes.\n\nKey limitations  \n• The paper offers no empirical validation of proposed interventions; confidence scores are therefore ≤ 3.  \n• Concrete implementation details for “delay AGI” are not provided, so that branch relies on moderate inference (edge-confidence 1-2).  \n• The personal-health branch is only indirectly related to AI safety; it is retained because the author quantifies its effect within the same model, keeping the fabric connected.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Global human extinction from misaligned AGI\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AI existential catastrophe\",
