Summary  
Data source overview: A startup co-founder recounts building “HoloAI”, an LLM-based creative-writing site, then halting further development after becoming worried about AI existential risk. The narrative argues that even small AI productization efforts can accelerate demand for more capable frontier models, thereby indirectly increasing X-risk, and wonders whether a social consensus should discourage such products.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[71]  
The source is short, largely anecdotal, and offers limited explicit causal detail, so many links rely on light inference (confidence 2). Nonetheless, the extracted fabric captures every explicit claim and stitches a coherent pathway from the stated risk (AI capability acceleration → X-risk) through the author’s reasoning to the proposed interventions (ceasing development and pushing for social norms).

How the instruction set could be improved:  
1. Provide examples for very short, non-technical sources to clarify acceptable inference depth.  
2. Clarify handling of narrative sections lacking formal “findings” so node categories like “validation evidence” can accommodate anecdotal evidence.  
3. Supply additional edge-verb examples suited for qualitative reasoning (e.g. “inferred_from”).  

Inference strategy justification:  
Because the text contains no formal experiments, I treated the author’s self-reported experience as weak “validation evidence” (edge confidence 2). Interventions were explicit (“we decided to stop”) or directly solicited (“what should social consensus be?”).

Extraction completeness explanation:  
All distinct reasoning steps—risk perception, market-driven capability acceleration, theoretical mechanism, choice to halt work, and call for societal norms—are captured, with no isolated nodes.

Key limitations:  
• Source lacks quantitative validation; edges rely on weak anecdotal evidence.  
• Only two interventions were identifiable; additional policy details are absent.  
• Some node phrasing requires inference to fit prescribed categories.
