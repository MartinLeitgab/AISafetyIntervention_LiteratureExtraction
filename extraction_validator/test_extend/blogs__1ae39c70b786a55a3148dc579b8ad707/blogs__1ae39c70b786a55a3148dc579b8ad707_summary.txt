Summary  
Data source overview: The post reviews Phil Birnbaum’s “Sabermetric Research” blog, highlighting several case-study deconstructions in which seemingly reasonable regression analyses in sports research were shown to give completely wrong answers once their hidden assumptions, axis choices, multicollinearity and coefficient interpretations were examined in depth. Although the examples are in sports, the author stresses that these methodological pitfalls are ubiquitous in social-science (and by extension AI-related) quantitative studies.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77]  
The source is short and largely expository, so only moderate detail is available for some causal links; however, the resulting knowledge fabric faithfully captures every explicit reasoning step (risks → regression flaws → deep audits → corrections) and maps them onto three concrete interventions.  
Instruction-set improvement: Provide an explicit example of how to convert purely methodological criticism (no explicit interventions) into AI-relevant interventions, and clarify whether policy-level or training-level actions should be classed as lifecycle “6 Other” or mapped onto the model-development lifecycle.

Inference strategy justification: The post does not spell out interventions; moderate inference (edge confidence 2) was applied to turn “rigorous deconstruction of regressions” into three actionable interventions that an AI-safety team could adopt (audit pipelines, diagnostic tools, peer-review checklists).

Extraction completeness explanation: All unique risks, methodological failure modes, insights, rationales, mechanisms and empirical demonstrations mentioned in the post were extracted. Node names follow the required granularity so they can merge with identical concepts across the 500 k-source corpus. All nodes participate in the connected fabric; no isolated nodes remain.

Key limitations:  
1. Empirical evidence is based on qualitative case studies (edge confidence ≤3).  
2. The interventions are inferred rather than explicitly proposed, so their maturity is low (1–2).  
3. The sports-specific examples were generalized to social-science/AI contexts; some nuance may be lost.
