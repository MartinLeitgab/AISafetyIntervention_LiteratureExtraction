          "text": "Summary  \n\nData source overview:  \nA short informal proposal argues that many current alignment schemes are overly complex and unlikely to work.  Inspired by biological evolution, it suggests training one much smarter language-model agent together with several far smaller, fully transparent “dumb” agents inside a game-like virtual world.  The smart agent receives a penalty whenever its actions reduce the dumb agents’ utilities, forcing it to infer those utilities and learn to cooperate.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[72]  \n\nInference strategy justification:  \nThe text is conceptual and contains no formal sections, experiments or implementation details.  Moderate inference (confidence 2) was required to map implicit reasoning into the canonical six concept-node categories and to articulate plausible implementation mechanisms and interventions.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation:  \nAll reasoning steps present in the text—risk → critique of existing approaches → evolutionary inspiration → cooperation incentive design → concrete multi-agent training setup → expected cooperative behaviour—are captured.  Two interventions (the multi-agent training paradigm and supporting interpretability research) terminate all causal paths, giving a fully connected fabric.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n• Evidence for effectiveness is purely conjectural (edge confidence ≤2).  \n• The proposal is sketchy; implementation details are inferred.  \n• No empirical validation node beyond a hypothetical claim could be extracted.  \n\nJSON knowledge fabric\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Unaligned superhuman AI behavior in multi-agent contexts\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AI misalignment leading
