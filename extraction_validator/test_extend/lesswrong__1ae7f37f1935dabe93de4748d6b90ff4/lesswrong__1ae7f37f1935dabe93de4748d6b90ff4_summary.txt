Summary  
Data source overview: The blog post informally critiques “person-affecting” population-ethical theories once the “further-fact” view of personal identity is rejected. It argues that if people are only pragmatic clusters of “person-moments”, then standard person-affecting views create severe comparability problems between possible futures. The author explores person-moment–based alternatives and concludes that a sliding-scale, preference-utilitarian approach might approximate moderate person-affecting intuitions.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73] – The core reasoning chain is philosophical and speculative but maps cleanly onto one connected causal-interventional fabric. All mandatory structural rules are satisfied and the JSON validates. The confidence is limited by having to infer AI-safety-relevant interventions from a non-technical ethics essay.  

Inference strategy justification: The paper never mentions AI systems, so moderate inference (edge confidence = 2) links the ethical reasoning failure to “value misalignment in AI population-level decisions” and derives two early-stage design interventions (utility-function definition and fine-tuning with preference data).  

Extraction completeness explanation: Every distinct step in the argument (risk of misaligned population ethics → comparability problem → rejection of further-fact → person-moment framing → sliding-scale design → algorithmic mechanisms → theoretical validation → interventions) is represented. All nodes are interconnected; no duplicates or satellites remain.  

Key limitations: 1) No empirical validation is provided by the source; our validation node therefore remains purely theoretical (confidence = 2). 2) Interventions are inferred, so maturity is foundational. 3) Fine granularity of philosophical distinctions may overlap with other sources; future ontology alignment work may be needed.



Improvements to instruction set: Allow optional, concise mapping guidelines for philosophical rather than empirical sources; provide explicit examples for translating abstract ethical arguments into AI-safety interventions; clarify expected node count scaling for shorter texts to avoid over- or under-fragmentation.
