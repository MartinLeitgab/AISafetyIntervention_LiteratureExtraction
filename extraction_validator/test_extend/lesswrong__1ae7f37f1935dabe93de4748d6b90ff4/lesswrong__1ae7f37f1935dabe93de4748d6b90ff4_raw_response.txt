          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The blog post informally critiques “person-affecting” population-ethical theories once the “further-fact” view of personal identity is rejected. It argues that if people are only pragmatic clusters of “person-moments”, then standard person-affecting views create severe comparability problems between possible futures. The author explores person-moment–based alternatives and concludes that a sliding-scale, preference-utilitarian approach might approximate moderate person-affecting intuitions.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73] – The core reasoning chain is philosophical and speculative but maps cleanly onto one connected causal-interventional fabric. All mandatory structural rules are satisfied and the JSON validates. The confidence is limited by having to infer AI-safety-relevant interventions from a non-technical ethics essay.  \n\nInference strategy justification: The paper never mentions AI systems, so moderate inference (edge confidence = 2) links the ethical reasoning failure to “value misalignment in AI population-level decisions” and derives two early-stage design interventions (utility-function definition and fine-tuning with preference data).  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: Every distinct step in the argument (risk of misaligned population ethics → comparability problem → rejection of further-fact → person-moment framing → sliding-scale design → algorithmic mechanisms → theoretical validation → interventions) is represented. All nodes are interconnected; no duplicates or satellites remain.  \n\nKey limitations: 1) No empirical validation is provided by the source; our validation node therefore remains purely theoretical (confidence = 2). 2) Interventions are inferred, so maturity is foundational. 3) Fine granularity of philosophical distinctions may overlap with other sources; future ontology alignment work may be needed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Value misalignment in AI population ethics decision-making\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"AI moral misalignment about future persons\", \"Incorrect AI valuation of future lives\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that advanced AI systems tasked with long-term planning adopt population-ethical principles that diverge from considered human judgments, leading to morally harmful decisions about creating or preventing future lives.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Opening paragraphs highlight how differing population-ethical views starkly change which worlds are judged better;
