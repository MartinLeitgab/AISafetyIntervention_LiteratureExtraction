Summary
Data source overview: The short AI Impacts “AI Vignettes Project” write-up (∼400 words) explains a programme that creates and iteratively refines concrete stories (vignettes) of future AI development to ground abstract risk discussions, surface hidden assumptions, and reduce scenario selection bias through small workshops and community feedback.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]

Inference strategy justification: The text is descriptive, not analytical, so moderate inference (edge confidence 2) was applied when connecting stated aims (“develop better intuitions”, “decrease bias”) to implied risks and to the proposed workshop process as an intervention.

Extraction completeness explanation: All information relevant to causal-interventional reasoning was captured—one primary risk path with six concept nodes and one intervention node, all interconnected, no satellites.

Key limitations: 1) Very limited empirical evidence forces low edge confidence; 2) Only one concrete intervention is present, so the fabric is necessarily small; 3) Social-process interventions may map less neatly onto the six concept categories designed for technical papers.

Instruction-set improvement suggestions: 1) Allow explicit acknowledgement when a source is primarily proposal-oriented with minimal empirical data, so lower node/edge counts are acceptable. 2) Provide clearer guidance for social or governance-oriented interventions that do not fit neatly into the 1-6 model lifecycle categories. 3) Clarify whether “addressed_by” vs. “mitigated_by” is preferred for problem→insight connections.
