Summary  
Data source overview: The essay discusses how Bayesian reasoning and formalizations of Occam’s Razor (Solomonoff Induction and Minimum-Message-Length) justify believing in “implied invisibles” (e.g., a photon that has left our future light-cone) while rejecting unsupported “additional invisibles.” It uses historical scientific examples (galaxies, quarks) to argue that model complexity is determined by description-length of laws rather than by the number of entities they imply.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]  
The post is qualitative and lacks explicit experimental results, so some intervention nodes are moderately inferred. Fabric structure and JSON formatting were double-checked.  

Inference-strategy justification: The article proposes no direct AI interventions; therefore, AI-relevant interventions (e.g., applying MML priors in AI model design) were moderately inferred from the author’s design-rationale discussions about correct Bayesian reasoning. Edges derived from logical structure of the argument were assigned confidence 2–3.  

Extraction completeness: All major reasoning steps—risk, two problem analyses, two theoretical insights, two design rationales, two implementation mechanisms, two validation evidences, and two actionable interventions—are captured and interconnected, forming a single fabric from the top-level risk to practical interventions.  

Key limitations:  
1. No empirical datasets—validation evidence relies on historical and theoretical arguments.  
2. Interventions are inferred, not directly tested.  
3. Section titles were absent; rationales reference nearest argumentative paragraphs instead.
