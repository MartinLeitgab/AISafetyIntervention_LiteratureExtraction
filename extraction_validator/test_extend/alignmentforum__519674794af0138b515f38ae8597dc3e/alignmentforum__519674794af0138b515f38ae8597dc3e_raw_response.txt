          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The post outlines a sub-project (“Immobile AI makes a move”) within a larger model-splintering research agenda.  A laser-wielding agent is first trained from a single, fixed viewpoint to move black cubes; then it is given full mobility in a 3-D environment with no further reward-function learning.  The author analyses the dangers of reward mis-generalisation (including ultra-conservative stasis and wire-heading) and proposes ways for the agent to generate candidate reward functions, penalise wire-heading, behave conservatively across hypotheses, and query humans for clarification.  \n\nExtraction confidence[78]  \nInference strategy justification: The post is conceptual, so edges from implementation mechanisms to validation evidence and from validation evidence to interventions rely on light inference (confidence = 2).  All other edges follow explicit reasoning in “Setup” and “Research aims”.  \nExtraction completeness: Every explicit risk, intermediate reasoning step and proposed solution in the post is captured; nodes are decomposed to the level needed for merge-ability across sources.  Four interventions cover all actionable proposals.  \nKey limitations: No empirical data were reported, so validation evidence is prospective.  Some edge types (specified_by, mitigated_by) were chosen by best fit but could vary with different ontological conventions.  The post briefly mentions a second top-level project (irrational‐preference learning) that lacks detail; it was excluded to keep the fabric connected.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n

Clarify whether prospective/ planned tests count as ‘validation evidence’ or require a separate ‘planned evidence’ category.  \n3. For conceptual papers lacking quantitative data, allow omission of ‘validation evidence’ nodes entirely, or define a ‘hypothesised evidence’ category to avoid forced low-confidence links."
