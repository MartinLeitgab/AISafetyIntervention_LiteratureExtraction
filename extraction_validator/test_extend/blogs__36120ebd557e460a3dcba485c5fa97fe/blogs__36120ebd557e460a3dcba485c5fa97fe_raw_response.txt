          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The AI Impacts article analyses half-a-century of progress in general-purpose integer factorisation. It documents how the largest numbers factored, the hardware used, and the pace of improvement (≈ 4.5 decimal digits/year) inform cryptographic security and more generally illustrate patterns of algorithmic progress.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82] – I am highly confident the JSON fabric is syntactically correct, every node is connected, node names follow the required granularity patterns, and the causal-interventional flows follow the mandated order. Confidence is not maximal because several causal links to AI-safety-relevant interventions required moderate inference from the “Relevance” and “Further research” sections.  \n\nInstruction-set improvement: 1) Provide an explicit list of allowed edge verbs and examples of how to choose when multiple seem plausible (“caused_by” vs. “enabled_by” vs. “required_by”). 2) Clarify whether multiple theoretical-insight nodes in the same path are acceptable or should be merged. 3) Give guidance on re-using validation-evidence nodes across multiple paths to maximise fabric inter-connectivity.  \n\nInference strategy justification: The paper itself does not prescribe interventions; I therefore applied “moderate inference” (confidence = 2) to derive AI-safety-relevant interventions (e.g., lengthening RSA keys or building forecasting models) that logically follow from the presented findings. All inferred links are marked with lower confidence ratings and explained in rationales.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All explicit claims about progress rate, hardware contribution and their security implications are captured. Two interconnected risk pathways—cryptographic security and AI progress forecasting—cover every paragraph in “Background”, “Trends”, “Hardware inputs”, “Further research”, and “Relevance”. Shared nodes (“Historical factoring record analysis…”) ensure one connected fabric. Fifteen concept nodes and three intervention nodes satisfy the expected density.  \n\nKey limitations: 1) Quantitative details (exact CPU-years, digit counts) were summarised rather than stored as separate nodes to avoid over-atomisation. 2) The interventions rely on expert inference, not direct prescriptions by the authors. 3) Evidence strengths were estimated qualitatively because the article does not supply statistical metrics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cryptographic vulnerability from integer factoring capability growth\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"RSA-breaking
