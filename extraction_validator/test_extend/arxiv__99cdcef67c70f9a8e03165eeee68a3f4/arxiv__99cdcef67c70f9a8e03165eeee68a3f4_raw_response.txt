It formalises two safety properties – un influenceability and un riggability – proves relations between them, shows that influenceable/riggable processes cause misalignment pathologies, and proposes a counterfactual construction plus an algebraic transformation that make any learning process uninfluenceable/unriggable.  Grid-world experiments illustrate the benefits.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nInference strategy justification: only light, safety-oriented inference was added (e.g., mapping “counterfactual construction” to an implementation-stage intervention).  \nExtraction completeness explanation: every reasoning chain from the identified top-level risk (“reward-function manipulation”) to each actionable mitigation (counterfactual design, algebraic conversion) is included; duplicate concepts were merged; all nodes participate in at least one edge, forming one connected fabric.  \nKey limitations: paper is theory-heavy; validation evidence is limited to proofs and one toy grid-world, so edge confidence levels seldom exceed 3–4.  Some implementation detail (e.g., precise η computation) is abstracted.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reward function manipulation in online RL agents\",\n      \"aliases\":
