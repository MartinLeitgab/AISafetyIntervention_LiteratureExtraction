Summary  
Data source overview: The issue brief “The Semiconductor Supply Chain: Assessing National Competitiveness” collates quantitative evidence about chokepoints, country-level monopolies and tacit know-how in advanced chip production.  It highlights how foundry capacity, lithography equipment, design‐software and raw-material control are concentrated in a handful of countries, creating strategic vulnerabilities for AI development.  No explicit policy program is proposed, but the data strongly motivate typical interventions already under discussion (CHIPS-style subsidies, export controls, allied raw-material agreements).

Extraction confidence [74]  
Inference strategy justification: Where the brief only offers descriptive statistics, moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to trace standard policy responses that AI-safety analysts routinely evaluate (e.g. export-control regimes).  
Extraction completeness: All quantitative facts that act as premises for any risk→intervention chain were captured as validation-evidence nodes, yielding four fully connected causal-interventional pathways sharing common upstream risk and design-rationale nodes; no orphan nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) The source is economic/strategic, not an AI technical paper, so paths end in geo-economic interventions rather than model-level mitigations. 2) Evidence strengths are mostly medium; no controlled experiments exist. 3) Node descriptions are brief to respect length limits; further sub-decomposition (e.g. split EUV vs ArF data) could refine the fabric.
