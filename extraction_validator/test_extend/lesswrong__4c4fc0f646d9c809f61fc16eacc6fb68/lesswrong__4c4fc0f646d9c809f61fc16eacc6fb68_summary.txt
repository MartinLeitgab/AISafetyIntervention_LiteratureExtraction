Summary  
Data source overview: The article summarizes Eli Dourado’s argument that, in the near term, even very powerful AI will not translate into large economy-wide productivity growth because the binding constraints in four of the largest sectors—housing, energy, transportation and health—are socio-legal and regulatory, not technological.  

Extraction confidence[78]  
Inference strategy: The article is largely qualitative and presents no formal experimental results. I therefore extracted explicit causal claims (e.g. “land-use rules block housing supply”) and, where necessary, used light inference (confidence = 2) to turn policy ideas implicitly recommended by the author into explicit interventions suitable for AI-safety-oriented effectiveness evaluation.  

Extraction completeness: All reasoning steps—from the top-level risk of continuing economic stagnation, through the identified policy bottlenecks, to the implied need for targeted regulatory reform—are represented. Each sector’s specific mechanism and matching intervention are included and linked through shared higher-level nodes, creating one connected knowledge fabric.  

Key limitations:  
1. The source offers only historical correlations, so evidential confidence is limited.  
2. No quantitative effect sizes are given; validation evidence is therefore indirect (TFP data).  
3. Interventions are policy-level; mapping them to the AI-safety lifecycle required judgment.  

How these instructions could be improved: The prompt could clarify how to treat socio-political interventions that sit outside the usual AI development lifecycle (e.g., mark them as lifecycle 6 “Other”). Explicit guidance on choosing edge directions when the problem analysis is “caused by” an upstream theoretical insight would reduce ambiguity.
