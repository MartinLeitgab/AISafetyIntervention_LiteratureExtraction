          "text": "Summary:\nThis podcast episode discusses Danijar Hafner’s “Crafter” environment—an automatically-generated, Minecraft-like world designed to benchmark reinforcement-learning (RL) agents on dozens of inter-dependent tasks. The core theme is that today’s AI progress toward more general agents is limited by poor ways of measuring generalization; Crafter is proposed as a remedy by providing diverse, dependency-rich tasks whose aggregated scores fingerprint an agent’s planning and exploration abilities.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[78]\n\nInference strategy justification:\nThe article is informal, so implicit causal links (e.g., why narrow benchmarks create measurement risk) had to be reconstructed with light inference (edge confidence 2). All nodes were kept at the granularity required by the prompt and decomposed (e.g., Crafter split into mechanisms and interventions).\n\nExtraction completeness explanation:\nEvery idea that participates in the core chain from the risk (poor generalization measurement) to the practical remedy (use and tune Crafter-style benchmarks) has been captured. All paths interconnect through shared nodes; no satellites exist.\n\nKey limitations:\n• The source offers qualitative claims, so validation evidence nodes rely on medium/weak confidence.\n• Only benchmarking-related safety aspects appear; broader misalignment issues are not covered.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Insufficient performance
