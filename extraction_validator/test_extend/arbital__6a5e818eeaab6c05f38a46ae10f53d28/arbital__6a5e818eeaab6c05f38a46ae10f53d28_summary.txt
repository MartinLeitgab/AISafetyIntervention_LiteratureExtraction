Summary  
Data source overview: The text discusses Löb’s theorem and its corollaries (Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem) showing that Peano Arithmetic (PA) cannot, on its own, prove that every statement it proves is true. Hence PA lacks “self-trust”. The note also remarks that any provability predicate satisfying the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions inherits this limitation.  

Inference strategy justification: The paper is purely mathematical, so no explicit AI-safety interventions are named. Moderate inference (confidence ≤ 2 on such edges) was used to translate the mathematical result into AI-safety-relevant reasoning about the reliability of formal verification frameworks and to surface two plausible classes of interventions: (1) layered meta-theoretic verification and (2) switching to stronger foundational theories.  

Extraction completeness explanation: All distinct explanatory steps in the text—risk, incompleteness mechanism, self-reference insight, two alternative design rationales, corresponding implementation mechanisms, theoretical validation evidence, and two actionable interventions—are represented. Every node is interconnected, no dangling satellites remain, and intervention nodes sit at the ends of the chains as required.  

Key limitations:  
1. Evidence for intervention effectiveness is theoretical, so edge confidence is at most 3.  
2. Only short textual source; deeper empirical validation data were unavailable.  
3. Some naming/edge choices (e.g., mitigated_by vs addressed_by) involve judgement calls that could vary between curators.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[57] – moderate; instructions followed exactly, but unavoidable inference lowers certainty.



Improvements to instruction set: Providing explicit guidance on handling purely theoretical sources without explicit interventions (e.g., logic or math papers) would help standardise when and how much inference is acceptable. Clarifying preferred edge verbs for “theoretical insight → design rationale” connections would reduce ambiguity. Finally, including canonical examples for “validation evidence” based on theorems (not experiments) would aid consistency across mathematics-heavy sources.
