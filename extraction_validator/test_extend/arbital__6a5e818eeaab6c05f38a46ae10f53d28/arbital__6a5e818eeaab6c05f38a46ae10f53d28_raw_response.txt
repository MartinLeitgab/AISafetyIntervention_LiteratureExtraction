          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The text discusses Löb’s theorem and its corollaries (Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem) showing that Peano Arithmetic (PA) cannot, on its own, prove that every statement it proves is true. Hence PA lacks “self-trust”. The note also remarks that any provability predicate satisfying the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions inherits this limitation.  \n\nInference strategy justification: The paper is purely mathematical, so no explicit AI-safety interventions are named. Moderate inference (confidence ≤ 2 on such edges) was used to translate the mathematical result into AI-safety-relevant reasoning about the reliability of formal verification frameworks and to surface two plausible classes of interventions: (1) layered meta-theoretic verification and (2) switching to stronger foundational theories.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All distinct explanatory steps in the text—risk, incompleteness mechanism, self-reference insight, two alternative design rationales, corresponding implementation mechanisms, theoretical validation evidence, and two actionable interventions—are represented. Every node is interconnected, no dangling satellites remain, and intervention nodes sit at the ends of the chains as required.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n1. Evidence for intervention effectiveness is theoretical, so edge confidence is at most 3.  \n2. Only short textual source; deeper empirical validation data were unavailable.  \n3. Some naming/edge choices (e.g., mitigated_by vs addressed_by) involve judgement calls that could vary between curators.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[57] – moderate; instructions followed exactly, but unavoidable inference lowers certainty.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"unreliable self-verification of formal reasoning systems in AI safety contexts\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"formal system self-trust failure\", \"lack of reliable self-consistency proofs\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"AI safety proofs often depend on formal logical systems.
