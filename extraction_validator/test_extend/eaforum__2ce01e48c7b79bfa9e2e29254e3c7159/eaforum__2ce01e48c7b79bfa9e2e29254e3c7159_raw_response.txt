          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The essay argues that even with technically aligned and responsibly-deployed transformative AI (TAI), there will be a time-lag (“uncanny valley”) before the economic value it produces is fairly distributed worldwide. During this gap, rapid, AI-driven economic disruption could inflict mass suffering, especially on populations outside the US and Western Europe. The author proposes an “AI Adaptation” research & policy agenda and outlines three illustrative policy mechanisms (global UBI, expanded safety nets, and an international disruption fund) to mitigate these risks.  \n\nExtraction CONFIDENCE[78]  \nInference strategy justification: The post is largely conceptual; it offers qualitative reasoning, historical analogies and tentative policies rather than empirical studies. Moderate inference (confidence 2) is therefore used for several edges to connect concepts into the mandated six-stage causal-interventional chain.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: Every distinct claim that forms part of the central argument (risk → problem mechanism → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → validation evidence → intervention) has been converted into a node. All three recommended policy levers are represented as intervention nodes, each fed by two validation evidence nodes, ensuring a connected fabric with no isolated components.  \nKey limitations: 1) Limited empirical data in the source means validation evidence nodes rely on historical analogy rather than controlled studies, lowering confidence. 2) Policy interventions are high-level; implementation detail is necessarily coarse. 3) Some edge verb selections (refined_by, specified_by) are best-fit rather than exact text matches because the source is discursive.  \n\nHow to improve instructions: Allow an explicit “explained_by” edge verb for theory → problem links; provide guidance for socio-economic policy papers whose interventions occur exclusively at deployment/governance layers; clarify handling of qualitative evidence strength scoring.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Mass economic suffering in vulnerable populations during transformative AI
