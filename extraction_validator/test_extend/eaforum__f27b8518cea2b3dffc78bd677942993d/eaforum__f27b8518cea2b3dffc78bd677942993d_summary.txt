Summary  
Data-source overview: The blog post critically examines the claim that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has ≥10 % chance of arriving within the next 10 years.  It surveys recent AI progress, historical patterns of technological improvement, resource-limitation arguments, expert-opinion surveys, and market signals, concluding that “short timelines” are <2 % likely.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[71] – Medium–high: the text is argumentative rather than technical, so causal reasoning is present but sparse; moderate inference was necessary to generate actionable interventions.  The JSON has been double-checked for node/edge consistency.  

Instruction-set improvement: For sources that mainly argue about probabilities (not methods), include an explicit rubric for creating “governance / meta-research” intervention nodes so that downstream fabrics keep policy-relevant pathways consistent.  

Inference-strategy justification: The post contains no explicit interventions; I used moderate inference (confidence = 2) to derive three governance-oriented interventions logically implied by the author’s call for evidence-based timeline estimation.  

Extraction completeness: All distinct causal claims that connect the risk of mis-prioritising AI safety work to empirical evidence and forecasting methods have been captured; duplicate and isolated nodes were removed, leaving one connected fabric.  

Key limitations:  
1. Evidence strength is generally qualitative, so edge confidences are ≤3.  
2. Only governance-style interventions could be inferred; no technical safety methods are discussed.  
3. Section titles were absent; paragraph-level references were used instead.
