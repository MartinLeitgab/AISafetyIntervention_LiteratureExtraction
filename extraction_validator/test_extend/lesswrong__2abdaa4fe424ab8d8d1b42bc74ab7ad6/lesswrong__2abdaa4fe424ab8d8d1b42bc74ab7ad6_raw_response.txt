          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: A short analytical note compares Sandberg & Bostrom’s 2008 estimates of FLOP requirements for whole-brain emulation (10¹⁵–10⁴³) with the FLOPs consumed by GPT-3 for inference (~10¹⁵) and training (~10²³ total / ~10³⁰ per-second). It observes that both sit in the 10¹⁵–10³⁰ band and asks whether this overlap is coincidental or indicates that we are closer to human-level AGI than expected.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87]  \nThis paper is brief and largely speculative, so only a compact knowledge fabric could be extracted. Confidence is reduced by the need to infer safety-relevant interventions.  \n\nInference strategy justification: The text contains no explicit safety interventions; I performed light, policy-oriented inference (edge confidence ≤2) to generate compute-governance interventions logically motivated by the compute-parity observation.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All explicit claims (brain-emulation compute table; GPT-3 compute numbers; coincidence question) were captured as nodes and linked in a single fabric from the risk of premature AGI appearance to two governance interventions.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n1. Limited empirical depth; validation evidence rests on a single example (GPT-3).  \n2. Interventions are inferred, not directly proposed by the author.  \n3. Compute is only one dimension of AGI progress; fabric does not cover data or algorithmic advances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Premature AGI emergence without adequate
