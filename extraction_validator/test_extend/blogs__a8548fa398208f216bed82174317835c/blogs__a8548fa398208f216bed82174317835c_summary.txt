Summary  
Data source overview: The paper introduces Retrieval-Enhanced Transformers (RETRO), an architecture that augments standard Transformer language models with a nearest-neighbour retrieval system over a massive text database. By conditioning generation on retrieved passages, RETRO achieves higher factual accuracy, interpretability, and parameter-efficiency than much larger dense models, while also enabling safety interventions through database editing.  

Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Instruction-set improvement suggestion: Provide an explicit list of acceptable edge verbs and examples of how to compose multiple implementation-mechanism nodes in sequence; clarify whether multiple validation evidences may converge on the same intervention without duplicating edges.  

Inference strategy justification: Where the text implied but did not explicitly spell out AI-safety interventions (e.g., database curation to remove unsafe content), “moderate inference” was applied and marked with confidence 2 edges. All other links are direct claims or data shown in the figures and accompanying narrative.  

Extraction completeness explanation: All distinct reasoning elements supporting RETRO’s ability to mitigate three top-level risks (hallucinations, energy cost, lack of interpretability) were decomposed into 15 concept nodes and traced, without isolated satellites, to two actionable interventions. Shared nodes ensure a single connected fabric.  

Key limitations: The paper contains limited quantitative safety metrics; therefore evidence strengths for safety-related links are medium. Real-world deployment maturity of RETRO was inferred from research benchmarks, not production use.  



Extraction checks:
✔ No risk–intervention direct connections.  
✔ All nodes participate in at least one edge; no duplicates or satellites.  
✔ Framework decomposed into component mechanisms.  
✔ JSON validates and node names exactly match edge references.
