Summary  
Data source overview: The article “Anticipation in LLMs” argues that present-day autoregressive language models (e.g. GPT-3/4) appear to produce text one token at a time without “thinking ahead”.  Using rhyme-constrained poetry, function–composition code problems and sentence-unscrambling prompts, the author finds repeated failures that would be solved easily by minimal planning.  The post concludes that the absence of internal anticipation limits models’ complex-reasoning reliability and sketches ways researchers might measure or train anticipation.

Inference strategy justification: The paper is largely diagnostic rather than prescriptive, so interventions (benchmarks, fine-tuning, architectural changes, prompt-level scratchpads) are moderately inferred from its design suggestions and discussion of what “would be useful”.  Confidence levels (1-3) are lowered where such inference was necessary.

Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps that link the top-level risk (unreliable complex reasoning) to actionable mitigations are captured through 20 interconnected nodes: 1 risk → 1 problem analysis → 3 theoretical insights → 4 design rationales → 3 implementation mechanisms → 4 validation evidences → 4 interventions.  Every node has at least one edge and no direct risk–intervention edges exist.

Key limitations:  
• The source gives no quantitative results, so evidence strength is medium or weak.  
• Architectural interventions are speculative (maturity 1).  
• Future work could refine node naming conventions for “anticipation” vs “planning”.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84]

Improvements to instruction set: Clarify how to assign edge types when evidence is negative (model failure) yet still validates a benchmark; add examples of edges from multiple validation evidences converging on one intervention; supply canonical wording for “benchmark/evaluation” interventions to minimise divergence across sources.
