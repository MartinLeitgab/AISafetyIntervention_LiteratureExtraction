          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The article “Anticipation in LLMs” argues that present-day autoregressive language models (e.g. GPT-3/4) appear to produce text one token at a time without “thinking ahead”.  Using rhyme-constrained poetry, function–composition code problems and sentence-unscrambling prompts, the author finds repeated failures that would be solved easily by minimal planning.  The post concludes that the absence of internal anticipation limits models’ complex-reasoning reliability and sketches ways researchers might measure or train anticipation.\n\nInference strategy justification: The paper is largely diagnostic rather than prescriptive, so interventions (benchmarks, fine-tuning, architectural changes, prompt-level scratchpads) are moderately inferred from its design suggestions and discussion of what “would be useful”.  Confidence levels (1-3) are lowered where such inference was necessary.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps that link the top-level risk (unreliable complex reasoning) to actionable mitigations are captured through 20 interconnected nodes: 1 risk → 1 problem analysis → 3 theoretical insights → 4 design rationales → 3 implementation mechanisms → 4 validation evidences → 4 interventions.  Every node has at least one edge and no direct risk–intervention edges exist.\n\nKey limitations:  \n• The source gives no quantitative results, so evidence strength is medium or weak.  \n• Architectural interventions are speculative (maturity 1).  \n• Future work could refine node naming conventions for “anticipation” vs “planning”.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[84]\n\nImprovements to instruction set: Clarify how to assign edge types when evidence is negative (model failure) yet still validates a benchmark; add examples of edges from multiple validation evidences converging on one intervention; supply canonical wording for “benchmark/evaluation” interventions to minimise divergence across sources.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Unreliable complex
