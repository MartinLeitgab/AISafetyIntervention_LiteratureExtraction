          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper reports an empirical comparison of three uncertainty–handling algorithms (simple Bayes, odds-likelihood, naïve Dempster-Shafer) inside Pathfinder, a medical expert system that diagnoses lymph-node disease.  Using a decision-theoretic utility model (micromorts) and an expert-rating scale, the authors show that simple Bayes combined with a Maximum-Expected-Utility (MEU) decision rule outperforms the other approaches; naïve D-S is markedly inferior.  They also describe design tactics such as clustering correlated features, and introduce a decision-theoretic evaluation framework.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  \nThe extraction captures every step the paper links from the top-level risk of harmful misdiagnosis through concrete problems (independence violations, prior overcounting, etc.), theory (why Bayes works), design rationales (adopt Bayes+MEU, use decision-theoretic metrics, cluster features), down to implementation mechanisms, experimental validation, and four actionable interventions.  Nodes are named at uniform granularity and cross-link properly; no isolated components remain.  Confidence is <100 because edge–verb choices (e.g. “specified_by” vs. “enabled_by”) involve some judgment.\n\nHow to improve the instruction set:  \n1. Supply a canonical mapping table that clarifies which edge verbs are preferred between each pair of consecutive node categories; this would cut ambiguity.  \n2. Add explicit guidance on how many validation-evidence nodes are desired when multiple statistical results appear in one section.  \n3. Clarify whether “motivates” edges should always originate from Validation Evidence or whether Theoretical Insight→Intervention shortcuts are acceptable when no empirical evidence is given.  \n\nInference strategy justification: Where the paper only implicitly suggested an action (e.g. “avoid naïve D-S”), moderate inference was applied and marked with lower maturity / confidence 2.  All other links are explicitly supported by the text.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: Each main causal factor discussed in the paper (independence violation, prior overcounting, disconfirmatory-evidence gap, likelihood wash-out, feature dependency) appears as a Problem-Analysis node.  All proposed solutions (simple Bayes, MEU rule, decision-theoretic evaluation, feature clustering) and their empirical confirmations are present with edges that mirror the narrative order.\n\nKey limitations:  \n• The source focuses on one medical domain; generalisability edges are not asserted.  \n• The fabric does not model every statistical nuance (e.g., full utility matrix details) to keep node count manageable.  \n• Some edge confidences are “3 – Medium” because only qualitative descriptions, not numeric results, were available for that claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Patient harm from diagnostic errors in lymph node pathology expert systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"misdiagnosis harm in lymph node diagnosis\", \"diagnostic error risk in Pathfinder\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Incorrect disease classification by expert systems such as Pathfinder can lead to inappropriate or delayed treatment, producing morbidity or mortality for patients.
