Summary  
Data source overview: The Arbital page introduces “3d9” (“beneficial”) as a reserved, speaker-dependent term in AI alignment theory that explicitly means “really actually good” rather than “apparently good.”  The page motivates the need for a precise term to avoid conflating true goodness with proxies that an AI could exploit.  

Extraction confidence[82]  
The short text contains only conceptual content with no explicit empirical studies or engineering proposals, so moderate inference was required to identify AI-safety-relevant interventions (terminology standardisation and tying specifications to meta-ethical frameworks).  The instructions were sufficient; improvements could include explicit guidance for very short, purely conceptual sources and examples of “documentation / terminology” interventions.  

Inference strategy justification  
Because the source gives no direct intervention description, I inferred the most plausible actions an alignment researcher would take based on the text: (1) adopt and propagate the reserved term to improve clarity and (2) embed meta-ethical grounding (e.g., extrapolated volition) in goal specifications.  Both are low-maturity, theory-stage interventions.  

Extraction completeness explanation  
All causal reasoning contained in the page (risk of illusory alignment → ambiguity of “good” → need for precise term → reserved term definition → clearer discussion) is represented.  Nodes are at merge-ready granularity, no isolated nodes remain, and two interventions conclude the paths.  

Key limitations  
• Very short source limits fabric richness.  
• Validation evidence is conceptual (confidence =2) because no empirical data are provided.  
• Interventions are inferred, hence low maturity/confidence.
