Summary  
Data source overview: The short essay argues that discussions about the long-term importance of shaping AI development often blur two categories of arguments: highly specific threat-model arguments and highly general arguments. The author claims that being explicit about this “argument-specificity dimension” would improve (1) how much society prioritises AI as a cause area and (2) how resources are allocated between different AI-related interventions. To illustrate, the post cites disagreement about plausible threat models, the “default” focus on very specific alignment scenarios, and the results of an expert survey showing large uncertainty.

Inference strategy justification: The post is meta-strategic rather than technical, so explicit interventions are not spelled out. Moderate inference was therefore used (confidence marked 2) to turn the author’s recommended practices—e.g., “people being more clear” about their argument type—into concrete, operational interventions such as “mandate specificity-taxonomy tagging in AI safety papers” and “update EA curricula”. These are faithful to the spirit of the source and are necessary to create full risk→intervention paths.

Extraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional pathways that the text touches on have been captured—starting from the top-level risk of “Loss of long-term human potential from misaligned transformative AI”, through the core problem of “Misprioritised AI safety interventions due to unclear argument specificity”, down to four actionable policy/coordination interventions. All nodes are connected; no duplicates or satellites remain.

Key limitations:  
1. The source provides no quantitative data, so edge confidences are mostly 2–3.  
2. Proposed interventions are policy/process oriented and may appear broad; finer technical interventions are not derivable from this text.  
3. Section titles in the original post are minimal; rationales therefore reference “The distinction” or “Why this distinction matters” as nearest available headings.

Improvements to instruction set: The current rules assume sources always present concrete interventions; meta-level policy texts like this require moderate inference. Explicit guidance on how detailed such inferred interventions should be, and example policy-level interventions, would reduce ambiguity. Additionally, providing a canonical set of policy lifecycle stages (separate from model lifecycle 1-5) would make classification clearer.
