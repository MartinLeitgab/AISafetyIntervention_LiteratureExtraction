Summary  
Data source overview: The article is a popular-math exposition that explains how to interpret logarithms with non-integer inputs by viewing “fractional digits” as probabilistic access to storage devices (“digit wheels”). It shows that sharing an n-state storage unit among k agents yields each, in expectation, √[k]{n} effective states, motivating the rule that half an n-digit corresponds to a √n-digit.  
Extraction CONFIDENCE[63] – The paper contains no explicit AI-safety content, so the causal-interventional fabric required for AI-safety analysis had to be produced with moderate inference. I am moderately confident that node definitions, edge types, and JSON format are correct, but confidence is limited by the speculative mapping from a mathematical exposition to AI storage-efficiency risks.  
Inference strategy justification: Following instructions, I inferred a transferable AI-safety-relevant risk—resource inefficiency in AI systems caused by misinterpreting information capacity—and constructed a full causal path to an intervention that directly applies the paper’s probabilistic-sharing idea to AI memory design. All inferences are marked with low edge-confidence scores.  
Extraction completeness: Every concept that forms part of the inferred reasoning chain (risk → problem analysis → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → validation evidence → intervention) is included and linked; no isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: • The entire fabric is speculative because the source text never mentions AI. • Validation evidence is purely mathematical; no empirical data. • Proposed intervention’s effectiveness for AI safety remains untested.



Improvements to instruction set: The current template mandates a full six-category causal chain even when the source lacks risks or interventions. Providing explicit guidance or an alternative “minimal fabric” mode for purely theoretical or mathematical sources would reduce speculative inference and improve accuracy. Clarifying how broad the definition of “AI safety relevant risk” may be (e.g., efficiency vs. alignment) would also aid consistency.
