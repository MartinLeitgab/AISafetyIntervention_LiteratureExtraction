Summary  
Data source overview: The Arbital article introduces “Vingean reflection”—the problem of an agent approving a successor (or its own future thoughts) without being able to predict that successor’s exact actions. Using Deep Blue’s designers as an illustrative case, it argues for abstract, quantifier-level reasoning and reflective-stability formalisms to keep successors aligned.  
EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  
Inference-strategy justification: The text is largely conceptual; no concrete engineering procedures are given. I therefore used light-to-moderate inference (edge confidence 2) to turn general prescriptions (“talk only inside quantifiers”, “reflective stability”) into explicit interventions useful for AI-safety analysis.  
Extraction completeness: All statements relating risks → unpredictability → abstract reasoning principles → reflective-stability design goals → implementation techniques → evidence (Deep Blue) → interventions are captured; every node is connected, and framework terms (“Vingean reflection”) are decomposed into their white-box components.  
Key limitations: 1) Only anecdotal validation evidence is available, limiting confidence. 2) The paper is short; some intermediate nodes are inferred to satisfy full causal-interventional chains. 3) Section titles are absent, so “Article body paragraph #” is used for traceability.



Improvements to instruction set: Providing examples with extremely short data sources (as here) would clarify the acceptable level of moderate inference. Also, guidance on handling sources without explicit section titles would reduce ambiguity in the “closest preceding section title” requirement.
