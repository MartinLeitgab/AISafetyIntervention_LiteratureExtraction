          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The Arbital article introduces “Vingean reflection”—the problem of an agent approving a successor (or its own future thoughts) without being able to predict that successor’s exact actions. Using Deep Blue’s designers as an illustrative case, it argues for abstract, quantifier-level reasoning and reflective-stability formalisms to keep successors aligned.  \nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  \nInference-strategy justification: The text is largely conceptual; no concrete engineering procedures are given. I therefore used light-to-moderate inference (edge confidence 2) to turn general prescriptions (“talk only inside quantifiers”, “reflective stability”) into explicit interventions useful for AI-safety analysis.  \nExtraction completeness: All statements relating risks → unpredictability → abstract reasoning principles → reflective-stability design goals → implementation techniques → evidence (Deep Blue) → interventions are captured; every node is connected, and framework terms (“Vingean reflection”) are decomposed into their white-box components.  \nKey limitations: 1) Only anecdotal validation evidence is available, limiting confidence. 2) The paper is short; some intermediate nodes are inferred to satisfy full causal-interventional chains. 3) Section titles are absent, so “Article body paragraph #” is used for traceability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Misaligned behavior of successor AI agents in self-modifying systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"successor

acceptable level of moderate inference. Also, guidance on handling sources without explicit section titles would reduce ambiguity in the “closest preceding section title” requirement."
