Multiple prompt variations are shown, all illustrating shallow pattern–matching and limited improvement from simple prompt engineering.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]  \nInference strategy justification: The paper contains no explicit safety interventions, so moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to derive two safety-relevant actions that logically follow from the author’s observations: (i) deploying chain-of-thought prompting to force explicit reasoning, and (ii) instituting a dedicated benchmark for physical common-sense tests. These inferences strictly use concepts already present in the source (different prompt frames, the “banana test” as implicit benchmark).  \nExtraction completeness: All claims that form causal chains from a top-level risk (incorrect physical reasoning) to actionable safety interventions were captured; every node is connected and no duplicates exist.  \nKey limitations: 1) Only two interventions could be responsibly inferred, so the fabric is necessarily sparse. 2) Validation evidence is based on small, anecdotal samples; stronger empirical work would raise edge confidences. 3) The node/edge naming scheme forces linear ordering even when real causal structure has feedback loops.\n\nJSON fabric follows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Incorrect physical common-sense reasoning in conversational AI\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"faulty physical reasoning in chatbots\", \"poor real-world common sense in LLM responses\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that large language models give advice or answers that ignore basic physical constraints, potentially misleading users or leading to unsafe decisions.
