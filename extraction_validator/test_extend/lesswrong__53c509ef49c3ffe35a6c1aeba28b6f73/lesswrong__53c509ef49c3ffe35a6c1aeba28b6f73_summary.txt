Summary  
Data-source overview: The blog post describes a “one-question Turing test” (“What food would you use to prop a book open and why?”) that reveals GPT-3’s tendency to give superficially plausible answers with little or no underlying physical-world reasoning. Multiple prompt variations are shown, all illustrating shallow pattern–matching and limited improvement from simple prompt engineering.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]  
Inference strategy justification: The paper contains no explicit safety interventions, so moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to derive two safety-relevant actions that logically follow from the author’s observations: (i) deploying chain-of-thought prompting to force explicit reasoning, and (ii) instituting a dedicated benchmark for physical common-sense tests. These inferences strictly use concepts already present in the source (different prompt frames, the “banana test” as implicit benchmark).  
Extraction completeness: All claims that form causal chains from a top-level risk (incorrect physical reasoning) to actionable safety interventions were captured; every node is connected and no duplicates exist.  
Key limitations: 1) Only two interventions could be responsibly inferred, so the fabric is necessarily sparse. 2) Validation evidence is based on small, anecdotal samples; stronger empirical work would raise edge confidences. 3) The node/edge naming scheme forces linear ordering even when real causal structure has feedback loops.

JSON fabric follows.



Improvements to instruction set  
1. Provide clear examples for edge orientation (“X caused_by Y” means X←Y or X→Y). Ambiguity forces guesswork.  
2. Allow a special “observation evidence” category when validation evidence precedes design, which often happens in exploratory papers.  
3. Expand canonical edge list with “enables” and explicit guidance on using “motivates” between non-intervention nodes to avoid edge-type mismatch.
