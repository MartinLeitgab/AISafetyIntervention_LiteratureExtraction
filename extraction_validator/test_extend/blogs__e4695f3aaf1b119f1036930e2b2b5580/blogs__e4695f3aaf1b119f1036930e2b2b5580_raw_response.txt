          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The document is a 2017–2021 Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) job advertisement for a “Machine-Learning Living Library” whose function is to read every interesting ML paper and keep the AI-alignment research team continuously informed. It argues that the fast-moving ML landscape risks leaving researchers uninformed, and proposes hiring a dedicated expert to mitigate this.  \nReport EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [64]  \nExplanation for improvement: This source is not a technical paper and contains no empirical studies; therefore only a minimal causal-interventional fabric—centred on “knowledge-obsolescence risk” and the hiring intervention—can be extracted. Guidance could clarify how to handle job ads and other non-technical texts (e.g., allow extremely small fabrics or explicit “no extractable fabric” outputs) to reduce ambiguity.  \nInference strategy justification: Moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to (a) identify the implicit risk that AI-alignment teams fall behind on ML progress, (b) model the causal chain from the rapid literature growth to that risk, and (c) treat the advertised hire as the proposed intervention.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps explicitly or implicitly present—risk → problem analysis → theoretical insight → design rationale → implementation mechanism → expected validation → intervention—have been captured. No additional distinct claims appear in the text.  \nKey limitations:  \n1. No real validation evidence is provided; the “validation” node is speculative.  \n2. Edges rely on inference rather than empirical data.  \n3. The intervention is organisational (hiring), not technical; downstream AI-safety relevance may be limited.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Knowledge obsolescence in AI
