          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The short discussion note highlights a meta-level risk: even if a technically perfect AI-safety solution is discovered, many AI developers may still ignore it. Four concrete reasons for non-adoption are listed (timeline optimism, conceptual complexity, competitive pressure, and disbelief). No explicit remedies are proposed, but obvious policy and educational counter-measures are implicitly invited.  \nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[67]  \nInstruction-set improvement: The current template assumes papers always contain complete method-finding-intervention chains. Very short opinion pieces like this rarely do. Allow skipping missing categories when the source genuinely lacks them, or explicitly allow light inference to fabricate minimal “validation evidence” nodes to keep the mandated path shape.  \nInference strategy justification: Because the text gives only risks and obstacles, I used moderate inference (edge confidence ≤ 2) to add theoretical incentives analysis, regulatory/educational design rationales, concrete implementation mechanisms, and plausible downstream interventions.  \nExtraction completeness: All four stated non-adoption reasons were turned into problem-analysis nodes and connected to inferred incentive-based theoretical insights. Each branch converges on regulatory and educational design rationales, concrete certification/tooling mechanisms, and three actionable interventions, forming one connected fabric.  \nKey limitations: Evidence nodes are inferred analogies rather than empirical studies; real-world validation data are absent. The short source limits node richness and confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Catastrophic AI failure from non-adoption of validated safety solution\",\n
