Summary  
Data source overview: The article analyses what people mean when they describe an entity as “wanting” or “goal-directed”. It argues that anthropomorphic, overly-coarse abstractions lead to conflating separable computational phenomena, and proposes a refined conceptual framework—grounded in examples ranging from ants to chess engines—for decomposing goal-directed behaviour.  
EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73] – Moderately high: the paper is largely conceptual with few explicit experimental claims, so several interventions are necessarily inferred (clearly flagged). JSON was validated for matching node names, connectivity, and formatting.  
Inference strategy justification: Because the text is conceptual, AI-safety-relevant interventions (e.g. adopting the new taxonomy in risk analyses) are inferred as logically implied next steps. Edges from validation evidence to interventions are given confidence 2 to reflect this inference.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All reasoning steps from the risk of mis-predicting AI behaviour → root causes (abstractive conflation, coupled impressions) → theoretical insight (decoupling abstractions) → design rationale (build clearer framework) → implementation mechanism (taxonomy of goal-directed dimensions) → validation evidence (improved cross-domain prediction) → actionable interventions are captured. No isolated nodes remain.  
Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence is mainly qualitative, limiting edge confidence; 2) Interventions are inferred, not tested; 3) Some section titles referenced (“Deliberation and Reflexes”) are mentioned but not excerpted, so rationales cite paragraph context rather than explicit headings.



Improvements to instruction set: Provide a list of canonical edge types allowed so extractors do not invent new verbs; clarify whether multiple risk nodes per source are required or optional; supply guidance on minimum/maximum nodes relative to text length.
