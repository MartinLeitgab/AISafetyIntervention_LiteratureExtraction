The authors conclude that people (and by extension artificial agents) fail at multi-goal pursuit not merely for motivational reasons but because complex goal structures are computationally intractable, and that designing tree-like goal systems should improve performance.  \n\nInference strategy justification: The paper is about human cognition, not AI safety directly. Moderate inference was therefore applied (edge confidence ≤ 2) to translate the validated human findings into AI-relevant interventions (e.g., structuring agent goal representations to have low tree-width, pruning high-tree-width sub-graphs during planning).  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional reasoning steps—from the top-level risk (failure to achieve goals) through problem analysis (NP-hardness), theoretical insights (role of tree-width), design rationale, concrete implementation mechanisms, empirical validation, and finally to actionable interventions—are captured. Every node participates in at least one edge, and no edge connects risk directly to an intervention.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n1. Validation evidence is based on human subjects, so transferring to AI agents is inferential.  \n2. The implementation mechanism is not explicitly implemented in the paper; it is derived from algorithmic suggestions—hence low maturity/confidence.  \n3. Only the main causal path was extracted; finer-grained predictors (edge/vertex expansion, feedback-vertex sets) were aggregated to maintain mergeable node granularity.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – High confidence in structural correctness; moderate uncertainty in mapping human findings to AI interventions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ineffective goal achievement in agents due to complex goal structures\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"goal pursuit failure from complex goal networks\", \"failure to achieve multiple goals\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Agents (human or artificial) frequently fail to realise intended goals when the network linking their available actions (means) to desired outcomes (goals) is computationally hard to navigate.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Highlighted in Introduction: authors note widespread failure to act on goals despite motivation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"NP-hard means selection complexity in goal systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"means selection NP-hardness\", \"Set Cover & Maximum Coverage hardness in goal systems\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Choosing a minimal set of means to achieve all goals (Set Cover) or picking a bounded set of means that maximises goals achieved (Maximum Coverage) maps directly onto NP-hard optimisation problems.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Formal analysis and predictions section defines the two NP-hard tasks that capture core computational difficulty.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Treewidth-driven computational difficulty in goal systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"treewidth affects difficulty\", \"tree-like structures facilitate algorithms\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Graph-theoretic parameters, especially tree-width and expansion, theoretically determine how hard Set Cover and Maximum Coverage instances are;
