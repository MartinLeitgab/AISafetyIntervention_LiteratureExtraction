Summary  
Data source overview: The paper models the mapping between goals and means as a bipartite graph and shows—across three large online experiments—that human success in two NP-hard goal–selection tasks (Set Cover, Maximum Coverage) is strongly predictable from graph-theoretic “tree-likeness” measures (e.g., tree-width, expansion). The authors conclude that people (and by extension artificial agents) fail at multi-goal pursuit not merely for motivational reasons but because complex goal structures are computationally intractable, and that designing tree-like goal systems should improve performance.  

Inference strategy justification: The paper is about human cognition, not AI safety directly. Moderate inference was therefore applied (edge confidence ≤ 2) to translate the validated human findings into AI-relevant interventions (e.g., structuring agent goal representations to have low tree-width, pruning high-tree-width sub-graphs during planning).  

Extraction completeness explanation: All causal-interventional reasoning steps—from the top-level risk (failure to achieve goals) through problem analysis (NP-hardness), theoretical insights (role of tree-width), design rationale, concrete implementation mechanisms, empirical validation, and finally to actionable interventions—are captured. Every node participates in at least one edge, and no edge connects risk directly to an intervention.  

Key limitations:  
1. Validation evidence is based on human subjects, so transferring to AI agents is inferential.  
2. The implementation mechanism is not explicitly implemented in the paper; it is derived from algorithmic suggestions—hence low maturity/confidence.  
3. Only the main causal path was extracted; finer-grained predictors (edge/vertex expansion, feedback-vertex sets) were aggregated to maintain mergeable node granularity.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[87] – High confidence in structural correctness; moderate uncertainty in mapping human findings to AI interventions.
