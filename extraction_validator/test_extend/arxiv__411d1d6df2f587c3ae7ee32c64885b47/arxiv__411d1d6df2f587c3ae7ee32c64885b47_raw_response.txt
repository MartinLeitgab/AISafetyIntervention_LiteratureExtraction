          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper introduces “teaming intelligence” for information agents used in open-source intelligence collection. It analyses shortcomings of purely manual and purely autonomous approaches, proposes human-agent “team design patterns” (e.g. phased autonomy, supervisory control, collaborative mode), and describes the proof-of-concept Collaborative Intelligence Analysis (CIA) tool that operationalises these patterns.  \nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE [71]  \nInference strategy justification: The article mostly describes design concepts rather than concrete experimental metrics; moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to frame proposed patterns as safety interventions and to connect descriptive statements to causal mechanisms.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: All explicit risks (un-correctable agent errors, privacy concerns) and implicit risk of delay from manual analysis are linked through stated problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, concrete mechanisms (CIA tool & monitoring interface) and the three actionable interventions. Nodes share vocabulary that will merge well with other sources (e.g. “phased autonomy pattern”).  \nKey limitations: Empirical validation is only preliminary; edge strengths are mostly medium or weak. Some implementation details are inferred because the paper announces future evaluation rather than reporting results.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Uncorrectable analytical
