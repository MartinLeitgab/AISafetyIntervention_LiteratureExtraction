Summary  
Data source overview: The paper proposes “Socially Aware Reinforcement Learning” (SARL) for an autonomous-vehicle single-track-road game where an AV must safely pass a human driver on a one-lane road.  SARL maximises a β-weighted linear combination of agent and human rewards, with β computed from reward-correlation in a small human-data set, and uses value-iteration on an MDP whose transition model embeds a probabilistic human-behaviour model derived with Laplace smoothing.  Experiments with 446 MTurk drivers show SARL decisively out-performs game-theoretic and RL baselines for both agent and human scores and is perceived as less aggressive and wiser.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
The fabric captures every explicit causal chain from crash risk → inaccurate human models → socially-aware utility design → MDP/value-iteration implementation → human evaluations → actionable interventions (data collection, β-selection, training, deployment).  Node names follow required granularity, no isolated nodes exist, and all interventions end every pathway.  Confidence could rise with independent schema validation.

Instruction-set improvement: add canonical examples for combining multiple problem-analysis nodes feeding the same risk; clarify direction semantics for required_by/enabled_by; supply a definitive edge-type glossary.

Inference strategy justification: Only light inference (conf. 2) used to connect “collect data” intervention to “limited dataset” problem and to project real-world deployment.

Extraction completeness explanation: 18 nodes (>15 / 5k-words rule) capture all distinct claims: risk, three problem analyses, two theoretical insights, one design rationale, five implementation mechanisms, two validation evidences, four interventions.  All nodes appear in at least one path.

Key limitations: paper focused on a toy grid; real-road dynamics not validated (edge confidence ≤2 for deployment); β-correlation formula only tested on one scenario.
