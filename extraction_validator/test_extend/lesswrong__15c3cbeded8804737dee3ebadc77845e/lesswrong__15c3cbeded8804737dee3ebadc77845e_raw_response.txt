          "text": "Summary  \nThe short LessWrong post argues that Infrabayesianism is a promising yet under-used decision-theoretic framework for alignment because (a) it solves the “realizability” problem and yields formal bounds on decision error, but (b) most researchers cannot understand the current write-ups. Two distinct but connected causal chains therefore emerge:  \n1. Technical safety risk from un-bounded decision error that Infrabayesianism could mitigate;  \n2. Meta-level risk that this mitigation never happens because of a communication bottleneck.  \nThe fabric below captures both pathways from the top-level risks to two actionable interventions: (i) incorporate an infrabayesian decision framework during model design, and (ii) hire an expert editor to create accessible materials so the first intervention becomes feasible.\n\nExtraction confidence[82] – I am reasonably sure all explicit reasoning steps in the source were captured, node names respect the granularity rules, and all nodes/edges inter-connect. Remaining uncertainty stems from the very small size of the source (few explicit “findings”) which required light inference for the validation evidence of the communication pathway.\n\nInference-strategy justification  \n• Only minimal, clearly-marked inference (edge confidence 2) was used where the post implies but does not explicitly demonstrate evidence (e.g. expected positive feedback from improved write-ups).  \n• No speculative technical details beyond what a safety researcher would reasonably infer from the text were added.\n\nExtraction completeness  \nThe post mainly contains claims, motivations and a call-to-action; no experimental data. All unique claims that are essential to move from risks to interventions have been extracted, and both causal chains are cross-linked (educational materials enable technical adoption), so no isolated sub-graphs remain.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Validation evidence nodes are theoretical rather than empirical because the source contains no experiments.  \n• Some edge types are necessarily low-confidence due to the narrative nature of the text.\n\nImprovements to instruction set  \nExplicit guidance for extremely short, non-technical sources might be useful (e.g. allow fewer than 6 concept categories if some are absent), but otherwise the procedure worked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Unbounded decision error in AI systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"decision error without bounds in AI agents\", \"uncontrolled decision mistakes by AI\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"AI systems that lack formal guarantees on the quality of their action choices may make harmful or catastrophic decisions, posing a primary alignment risk.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Highlighted in the post as the key safety-relevant quantity; decision error is harder to bound than predictive error.
