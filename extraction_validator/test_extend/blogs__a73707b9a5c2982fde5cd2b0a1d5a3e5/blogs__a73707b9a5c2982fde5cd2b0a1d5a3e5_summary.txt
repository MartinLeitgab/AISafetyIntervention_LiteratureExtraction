Summary  
Data source overview: The short essay “Communicating Clearly” argues that conversational misunderstandings often arise from speakers assigning idiosyncratic or contested meanings to common words. The author proposes four concrete habits—avoiding unclear terms, merging near-synonyms, explicitly defining personally-used terms, and openly signalling these practices—to increase clarity.  
Extraction CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy justification: The text is advisory rather than empirical, so I inferred an AI-safety-relevant intervention (automatic text-rewriting / prompt-sanitising) that operationalises the author’s guidelines. All inferences are marked with low–medium confidence (2) on the corresponding edges.  
Extraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning element in the essay (risk, mechanism, insight, solution approach, concrete habits, anecdotal evidence) is captured. All paths converge into a single interconnected fabric ending in one actionable intervention node, satisfying mandatory success criteria.  
Key limitations: Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed habits is anecdotal, so validation remains weak. The small source length limits node richness; future prompts could encourage inclusion of additional empirical studies on language ambiguity to strengthen validation edges.



Improvements to instruction set:  
1. Provide explicit guidance for extremely short sources (<1000 words) on the expected minimum node count, avoiding under- or over-extraction ambiguity.  
2. Clarify how to reference sections when the source lacks headings; suggest allowable generic references (e.g., “introduction paragraph 1”).  
3. Offer a standard way to convert purely human-communication advice into AI-safety interventions, ensuring consistent inference levels across annotators.
