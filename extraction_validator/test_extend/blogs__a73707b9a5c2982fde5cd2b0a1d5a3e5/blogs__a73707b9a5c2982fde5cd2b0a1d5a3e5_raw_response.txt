          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The short essay “Communicating Clearly” argues that conversational misunderstandings often arise from speakers assigning idiosyncratic or contested meanings to common words. The author proposes four concrete habits—avoiding unclear terms, merging near-synonyms, explicitly defining personally-used terms, and openly signalling these practices—to increase clarity.  \nExtraction CONFIDENCE[83]  \nInference strategy justification: The text is advisory rather than empirical, so I inferred an AI-safety-relevant intervention (automatic text-rewriting / prompt-sanitising) that operationalises the author’s guidelines. All inferences are marked with low–medium confidence (2) on the corresponding edges.  \nExtraction completeness explanation: Every reasoning element in the essay (risk, mechanism, insight, solution approach, concrete habits, anecdotal evidence) is captured. All paths converge into a single interconnected fabric ending in one actionable intervention node, satisfying mandatory success criteria.  \nKey limitations: Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed habits is anecdotal, so validation remains weak. The small source length limits node richness; future prompts could encourage inclusion of additional empirical studies on language ambiguity to strengthen validation edges.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"miscommunication from ambiguous terminology in interpersonal discourse\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"semantic ambiguity miscommunication\", \"language misunderstanding due to vague words\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Breakdowns in mutual understanding arising when conversation participants use words that carry multiple, contested or idiosyncratic meanings.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Opening paragraph highlights the core risk that unclear language impedes communication (Communicating Clearly – introduction).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"alternate meaning attribution to common terms in discourse\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"idiosyncratic word interpretation\", \"personal definitions causing ambiguity\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Individuals assign special importance or private meanings to widely-used words, which generates divergent interpretations across speakers.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Essay notes conspiracy theorists ‘attribute special importance or personal/alternate meanings to commonly used words’ (same section).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"using precise uncontested terminology reduces interpretive variance in discourse\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"precision lowers misunderstanding\", \"clear terms improve comprehension\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Selecting words with stable, narrow meanings minimises the scope for divergent interpretation among recipients.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Author asserts that avoiding highly contested words makes intended meaning clearer (bullet list item 1).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"systematic avoidance of ambiguous contested words in discourse\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"avoidance of unclear terms\", \"exclusion of vague vocabulary\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Communication strategy that proactively filters out words known to be polysemous, politically charged or philosophically disputed.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"design rationale\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Bullet list presents deliberate steps to sidestep words like ‘consciousness’ or ‘free will’.

Provide explicit guidance for extremely short sources (<1000 words) on the expected minimum node count, avoiding under- or over-extraction ambiguity.  \n2. Clarify how to reference sections when the source lacks headings; suggest allowable generic references (e.g., “introduction paragraph 1”).  \n3. Offer a standard way to convert purely human-communication advice into AI-safety interventions, ensuring consistent inference levels across annotators."
