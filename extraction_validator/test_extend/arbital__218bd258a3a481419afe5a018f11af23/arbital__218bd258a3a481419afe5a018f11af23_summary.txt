Summary  
Data source overview: The short Arbital article explains the mathematical “colon-to” notation — $f : X \to Y$ — which specifies that a function’s domain is $X$ and its codomain is $Y$, and illustrates the notation with several examples. Although the text does not mention AI safety, unambiguous specification of functions is critical for formal verification methods used in AI-safety-relevant proof systems.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[63] – Moderate confidence because the article is very small and contains no explicit AI-safety material; the causal-interventional fabric therefore relies on moderate inference (edge confidence 1-2). Instructions could be improved by clarifying how aggressively to infer AI-safety-relevant risks/interventions from highly generic technical notes.  

Inference-strategy justification: To satisfy the mandatory requirement that every path start with a risk and end with an intervention, I inferred how ambiguous mathematical notation can cause specification errors in formal verification of AI systems, and how adopting unequivocal colon-to notation could mitigate that risk.  

Extraction-completeness explanation: All distinct claims about the notation (its meaning, its ability to define domain/codomain, examples) are captured as nodes that form a single connected reasoning chain from an inferred AI-safety risk to a concrete policy intervention. No concepts were left isolated.  

Key limitations:  
1. Heavy reliance on inference; actual empirical validation is weak.  
2. Very small source text limits richness of the resulting fabric.  
3. The intervention’s maturity and lifecycle assignment are approximate.
