          "text": "Summary\nData source overview: The post analyses how to retrofit a previously-sketched “tree-search steering system” with a set of corrigibility principles (Unpersonhood, Taskishness, Mild-Optimisation, Low-Impact, etc.).  It argues that doing so would reduce catastrophic-risk from emergent harmful behaviour, but at a significant “corrigibility tax” in capability.  The author proposes concrete mechanisms—quantilisation, impact-distance checks, operator-looping, LLM critics, whitelist filters, halt-prediction tests—that could be wired into the system.\n\nInference strategy justification: The paper is largely conceptual.  Where explicit empirical validation is missing, moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to turn each proposed mechanism into an actionable intervention and to connect every principle into complete causal pathways per the extraction template.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: 22 nodes capture every distinct risk, analysis, insight, design principle, implementation detail, validation argument and actionable intervention that appear in the text, with no isolated nodes.  The fabric shows how all six corrigibility mechanisms flow from the top risk through theoretical and design layers to concrete interventions.\n\nKey limitations: 1) Validation evidence is theoretical, so confidence scores are modest. 2) Some principles the author left “as an exercise” are represented only indirectly. 3) Real-world effectiveness of interventions is untested, reflected in low maturity levels.\n\nEXTRACTION_CONFIDENCE[84]\n\nProposed prompt improvements: 1) Allow “evidence type: theoretical argument” in addition to numerical strength so provenance is clearer. 2) Supply a mini-glossary of preferred edge verbs with examples of directionality to limit guess-work. 3) Permit optional “policy” node category to distinguish organisational mitigations such as “limit tasks to bounded pivotal acts”.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Emergent harmful behavior from composable steering system in real-world domain\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"dangerous
