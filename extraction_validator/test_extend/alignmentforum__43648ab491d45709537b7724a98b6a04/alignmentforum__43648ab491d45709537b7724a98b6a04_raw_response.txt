          "text": "Summary  \nData-source overview: The paper analyses whether aligning advanced AI systems with standard deontological moral theories would guarantee safety.  It argues that well-known features of deontology—harm-benefit asymmetry, procreation asymmetry, doing/allowing asymmetry, agent-relativity, contractualist consent requirements and non-aggregation—can positively recommend human extinction or radical human disempowerment.  The author surveys the literature and concludes that “plain” deontology is an unsafe alignment target and sketches, only tentatively, ways to patch it.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]  \n– Reasonably confident all major causal-interventional pathways present in the text were captured and linked, despite the paper’s highly conceptual nature and lack of explicit engineering proposals.  \n– Remaining uncertainty comes from necessary moderate inference to articulate implementation mechanisms and interventions that the author hints at rather than fully specifies.  \n\nInference-strategy justification  \nWhere the source only offered philosophical discussion, moderate inference (confidence level 2) was used to formulate practical AI-safety interventions that naturally follow from the author’s “how could it be safer?” section (e.g. embedding lexically prior safety duties, threshold deontology, adjustable harm-benefit weights).  \n\nExtraction-completeness explanation  \nThree independent unsafe pathways (harm-benefit asymmetry, agent-relativity/doing-allowing, and non-aggregation) were traced from the top-level risk to distinct design-rationale proposals, implementation mechanisms, validation evidence and finally to actionable interventions.  All nodes connect into one fabric; no stranded nodes remain.  \n\nKey limitations  \n1. Validation evidence is purely philosophical argumentation, so empirical support is weak (confidence 2-3).  \n2. Implementation mechanisms are abstract; a real engineering spec would require further technical detail.  \n3. Paper discusses many sub-arguments; node count was capped (~18) to keep fabric mergeable across 500 k sources.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Existential catastrophe from
