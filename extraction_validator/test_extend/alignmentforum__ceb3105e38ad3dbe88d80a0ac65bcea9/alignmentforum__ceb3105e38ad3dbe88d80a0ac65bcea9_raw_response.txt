These algebraic tools are presented with world-level definitions, dualities, idempotence and biextensional-equivalence proofs.  For AI-safety analysis they supply the missing machinery needed to model and reason about complex agent/environment boundaries, commitments and modular subsystems.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  \n– Strengths: clear mapping from paper structure to concept categories; nodes use merge-friendly names; all edges connect into one fabric; JSON validated.  \n– Improvements: richer empirical validation nodes would be possible if the source contained experiments; future prompt variants could instruct inclusion of more formal-logic detail as separate validation-evidence nodes for each proof family.\n\nInference strategy justification  \nThe paper is purely theoretical.  Interventions applicable to AI safety are inferred by translating the formal operations into concrete modelling recommendations; edges involving this step are marked with lower confidence (2).\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nAll distinct claims that advance the central reasoning—risk → need for operations → mathematical construction → formal guarantees—are captured.  Each of the four operations is represented inside the implementation-mechanism node, connected through proofs to the interventions.  No isolated nodes remain.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Real-world efficacy of the interventions is speculative.  \n• Only one combined validation node is extracted because proofs share identical structure; finer granularity could be added if needed.  \n• Down-stream tools must map these abstract interventions onto concrete software practices.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"mis-specification of agent-environment boundaries in AI safety modelling\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"boundary misdefinition in alignment research\", \"incorrect agent–environment separation\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Risk that safety analyses or system designs choose the wrong place to draw the line between an AI agent and its environment, leading to misunderstood capabilities, control and alignment failure.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Introduced as the top-level hazard that motivates needing formal decomposition tools;
