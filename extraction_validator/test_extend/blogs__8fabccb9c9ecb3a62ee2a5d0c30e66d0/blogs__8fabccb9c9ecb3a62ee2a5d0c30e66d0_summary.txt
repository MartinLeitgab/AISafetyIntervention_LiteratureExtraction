Summary:
The December 2015 MIRI newsletter is a brief meta-update summarising two newly-accepted safety papers (“Formalizing Convergent Instrumental Goals” and “Quantilizers: A Safer Alternative to Maximizers for Limited Optimization”) plus related research on corrigibility and strategic AI‐risk work. Although terse, it explicitly links a well-known top-level risk (existential catastrophe from misaligned AGI) to concrete safety proposals (quantilizers, formal analysis of convergent instrumental goals, increased safety-research funding). The extraction therefore relies partly on moderate inference to reconstruct the complete risk→intervention reasoning chains that the cited papers develop in detail.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[72]  
• Strengths: all nodes connect in a single fabric; no direct Risk→Intervention edges; framework names decomposed; JSON validated.  
• Weaknesses: source text is short and high-level, forcing moderate inference (edge confidence mostly 2–3).  
Prompt-improvement suggestion: allow explicit “meta-sources” with sparse technical detail to supply canonical references so that the extractor can cite external paper sections when the newsletter itself is only a pointer. That would raise edge confidence scores.

Inference strategy justification:
Where the newsletter gives only titles and one-sentence summaries, canonical results of the cited papers (e.g., quantilizer algorithm, formal CIG proofs) were inferred from the original papers (common knowledge in the safety community) to build a coherent fabric. All such edges are marked confidence 2.

Extraction completeness explanation:
Every distinct safety-relevant claim in the newsletter is represented: (1) existential-risk concern, (2) convergent-goal mechanism, (3) over-maximisation problem, (4) theoretical formulations, (5) design rationales (limit optimisation, formal proofs), (6) implementations (quantilizer sampling, formal agent models), (7) validation evidence (accepted papers), and (8) interventions (deploy quantilizers, integrate CIG analysis, fund safety centres). No isolated nodes remain.

Key limitations:
• Empirical validation nodes are theoretical (papers not yet empirically tested).  
• Newsletter does not detail methodologies, so node descriptions are concise and rely on background knowledge.  
• Funding/centre-creation intervention modelled generically; actual governance mechanisms not specified.
