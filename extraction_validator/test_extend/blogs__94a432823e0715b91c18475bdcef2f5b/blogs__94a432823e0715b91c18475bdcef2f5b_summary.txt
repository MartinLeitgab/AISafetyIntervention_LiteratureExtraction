Data source overview  
The article argues that both climate and AI-safety experts sometimes answer many distinct risk questions with the same level of “doominess”.  The author hypothesises the existence of a “general factor of doom” bias that causes correlated, possibly over-pessimistic answers and recommends surveying AI-safety researchers with multiple uncorrelated questions and forcing independent scenario analysis to detect and counteract this bias.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82]  
Inference strategy justification: The source is an opinion essay with few explicit solution details, so moderate inference (confidence = 2) was applied to turn the author’s survey proposal and scenario-building suggestion into explicit AI-safety interventions and to map the reasoning chain into the required six concept categories.  
Extraction completeness: All causal-interventional paths that begin with the risk of biased AI-safety decisions and end with the two actionable interventions proposed (multi-question surveys; structured scenario analysis) are fully included, with 15 interconnected nodes and 23 edges.  Each node is referenced by at least one edge, the two suggested frameworks are decomposed, and no risk→intervention shortcut appears.  
Key limitations: 1) Evidence strength is low–medium because the essay is speculative; 2) Section titles were absent, so rationales point to paragraph summaries; 3) Interventions are early-stage and non-technical, so lifecycle mapping used category 6 (“Other”), which may need refinement for organisational processes.

How to improve the instruction set: provide explicit examples covering social-science papers and opinion pieces so that edge-type selection and lifecycle mapping for governance or research-process interventions is less ambiguous; clarify whether multiple design rationales may branch from one theoretical insight.
