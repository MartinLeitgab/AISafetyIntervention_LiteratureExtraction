Summary  
Data source overview: The Arbital essay discusses the concept of “correlated coverage”—the hope that mastering a compact core principle will generalise to all later cases—and contrasts it with “patch-resistant” value misalignment that arises when safety coverage is uncorrelated across countless Humean degrees of freedom. It analyses several candidate core principles (low-impact, anapartistic reasoning, and Do-What-I-Mean) and argues by analogy with human epistemology that such principles could yield robust alignment.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77] – The paper is philosophical and lacks quantitative data, so edges are assigned medium or weak confidence. Fabric obeys all structural rules; JSON validated.  

Inference strategy justification: No concrete algorithms were specified; interventions had to be moderately inferred from each candidate core principle. All such inference steps are marked with confidence 2 and rationales cite the relevant passage.  

Extraction completeness explanation: Every unique claim about risk, mechanisms, principles, and proposed solutions that participates in any causal-interventional chain has been captured (16 nodes, 15 edges). All branches connect through the central “correlated coverage” theoretical insight, forming one integrated fabric.  

Key limitations:  
• Evidence is entirely conceptual, so edge confidence is limited.  
• Exact implementation details for interventions are inferred, not given.  
• Section titles were absent, so “main text” is used as closest section reference.  



We have checked:  
• No edge links risk directly to an intervention.  
• All nodes participate in at least one edge.  
• All branches interconnect via “Correlated coverage principle for robust alignment”.  
• Framework names are decomposed.  
• JSON validated for matching node names.
