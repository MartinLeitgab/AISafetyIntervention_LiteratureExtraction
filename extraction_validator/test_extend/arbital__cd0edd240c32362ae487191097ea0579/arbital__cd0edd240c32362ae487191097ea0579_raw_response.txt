          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The Arbital essay discusses the concept of “correlated coverage”—the hope that mastering a compact core principle will generalise to all later cases—and contrasts it with “patch-resistant” value misalignment that arises when safety coverage is uncorrelated across countless Humean degrees of freedom. It analyses several candidate core principles (low-impact, anapartistic reasoning, and Do-What-I-Mean) and argues by analogy with human epistemology that such principles could yield robust alignment.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77] – The paper is philosophical and lacks quantitative data, so edges are assigned medium or weak confidence. Fabric obeys all structural rules; JSON validated.  \n\nInference strategy justification: No concrete algorithms were specified; interventions had to be moderately inferred from each candidate core principle. All such inference steps are marked with confidence 2 and rationales cite the relevant passage.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: Every unique claim about risk, mechanisms, principles, and proposed solutions that participates in any causal-interventional chain has been captured (16 nodes, 15 edges). All branches connect through the central “correlated coverage” theoretical insight, forming one integrated fabric.  \n\nKey limitations:  \n• Evidence is entirely conceptual, so edge confidence is limited.  \n• Exact implementation details for interventions are inferred, not given.  \n• Section titles were absent, so “main text” is used as closest section reference.  \n\n```json\n{\n
