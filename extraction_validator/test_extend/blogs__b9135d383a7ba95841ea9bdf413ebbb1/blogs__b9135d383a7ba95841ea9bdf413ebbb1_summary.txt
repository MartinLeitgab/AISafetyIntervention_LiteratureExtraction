Summary of data source:
A November 2016 newsletter from the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) briefly reports on new talks, papers and workshops regarding AI alignment research topics such as Reduced-Impact AI, Logical Induction, Bias-Detecting Online Learners and Reliability Amplification. Although no single study is presented in full detail, the newsletter explicitly flags multiple causal-interventional ideas aimed at reducing existential catastrophe risk from misaligned super-intelligent AI.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[71]  
The newsletter is short, so many intra-path details had to be filled in by moderate inference from well-known MIRI/Christiano work that is explicitly referenced. Paths were kept conservative and traceable to the three newsletter section headers. The JSON validates and every node is connected, but evidence strength is mostly “2-Medium/Weak” because the source itself gives only pointers, not empirical results. Improving the instruction set: provide an optional “pointer-only source” policy explicitly acknowledging that some sources merely cite external research; allow “pointer evidence” as a distinct confidence category to avoid repeatedly using “2-Weak”.

Inference-strategy justification:
• Used publicly-known content of the cited talks/papers to flesh out minimal white-box nodes (e.g., what “Reduced-Impact AI” actually does).  
• Applied moderate inference (confidence = 2) whenever the newsletter only named, but did not describe, the mechanism.  
• Ensured each inference is grounded by a newsletter citation (closest section title).

Extraction completeness explanation:
All distinct risk→problem→insight→rationale→mechanism→evidence→intervention chains that the newsletter explicitly references (Reduced-Impact, Bias-Detection, Reliability Amplification, Logical Induction) are captured. Four interventions were extracted, each ending a fully connected path originating from the same top-level existential-risk node.

Key limitations:
• Evidence nodes rely on theoretical proofs or workshops; no quantitative benchmarks are reported.  
• Logical Induction, Bias Detection and Reliability Amplification paths could be decomposed further if the underlying papers were available.  
• The newsletter mentions Robust Cooperation but provides too little detail for a confident separate path.
