Data source overview:  
The post is an informal LessWrong forum message in which an operations-research leader contemplates a PhD topic on AI alignment.  The author reflects on unintended consequences of AI systems (outer-alignment failures), cites The Social Dilemma and “confusing the rule for the space”, and proposes using computational game theory, causal inference, system modelling and operations-research techniques to anticipate such failures.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]

Inference strategy justification:  
Because the text is aspirational rather than a technical study, explicit method → finding → intervention chains are sparse.  Moderate inference (edge-confidence 2) was applied to:  
• elevate informal examples (e.g. social-media recommender failures) to validation-evidence nodes,  
• elaborate the implied design/implementation steps required to turn “use game theory” into concrete interventions.

Extraction completeness explanation:  
All reasoning steps expressed or strongly implied were captured: starting from the risk of unintended consequences, through incentive misalignment mechanisms, Goodhart-style metric confusion, the theoretical value of game-theoretic modelling, design and implementation strategies, historical validation (social-media case), to two actionable interventions.  All nodes inter-connect into a single fabric with no satellites.

Key limitations:  
• Evidence is anecdotal; therefore most edge confidences are 2 (weak).  
• No quantitative results are in the source, so validation evidence is approximate.  
• Additional nodes could be created if future posts supply detailed empirical studies.

Instruction-set improvement suggestions:  
1. Provide guidance for posts that lack explicit section headings so node_rationale can reference paragraph numbers instead.  
2. Clarify acceptable minimum node count for <1 k-word sources; current 15/5 000 heuristic can be hard to scale.  
3. Include an example where interventions branch from the same validation evidence, mirroring common weakly-specified sources like this one.
