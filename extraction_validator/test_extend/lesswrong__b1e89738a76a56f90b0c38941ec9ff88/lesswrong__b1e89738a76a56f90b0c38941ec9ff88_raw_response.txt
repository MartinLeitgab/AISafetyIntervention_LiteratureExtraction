          "text": "Data source overview:  \nThe post is an informal LessWrong forum message in which an operations-research leader contemplates a PhD topic on AI alignment.  The author reflects on unintended consequences of AI systems (outer-alignment failures), cites The Social Dilemma and “confusing the rule for the space”, and proposes using computational game theory, causal inference, system modelling and operations-research techniques to anticipate such failures.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[73]\n\nInference strategy justification:  \nBecause the text is aspirational rather than a technical study, explicit method → finding → intervention chains are sparse.  Moderate inference (edge-confidence 2) was applied to:  \n• elevate informal examples (e.g. social-media recommender failures) to validation-evidence nodes,  \n• elaborate the implied design/implementation steps required to turn “use game theory” into concrete interventions.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation:  \nAll reasoning steps expressed or strongly implied were captured: starting from the risk of unintended consequences, through incentive misalignment mechanisms, Goodhart-style metric confusion, the theoretical value of game-theoretic modelling, design and implementation strategies, historical validation (social-media case), to two actionable interventions.  All nodes inter-connect into a single fabric with no satellites.\n\nKey limitations:  \n• Evidence is anecdotal; therefore most edge confidences are 2 (weak).  \n• No quantitative results are in the source, so validation evidence is approximate.  \n• Additional nodes could be created if future posts supply detailed empirical studies.\n\nInstruction-set improvement suggestions:  \n1. Provide guidance for posts that lack explicit section headings so node_rationale can reference paragraph numbers instead.  \n2. Clarify acceptable minimum node count for <1 k-word sources; current 15/5 000 heuristic can be hard to scale.  \n3. Include an example where interventions branch from the same validation evidence, mirroring common weakly-specified sources like this one.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Unintended consequences from outer alignment failures in AI systems\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"outer alignment failure consequences\", \"misaligned AI unintended outcomes\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"AI systems whose objective functions are not truly aligned with human values can produce harmful or counter-productive real-world behaviours.
