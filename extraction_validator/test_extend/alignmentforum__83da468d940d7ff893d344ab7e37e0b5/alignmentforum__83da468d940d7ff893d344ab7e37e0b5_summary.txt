Summary  
Data-source overview: The blog post surveys speculative, non-agentic AI risks such as AI-enabled totalitarianism, “slow-rolling catastrophes” from narrow metric optimisation, great-power conflict from autonomous weapons, large-scale manipulation via AI propaganda, and exploitation of future digital minds.  For each risk the author sketches mechanisms (e.g. AI-driven mass surveillance, economic inequality, psychological vulnerability) and mentions or implies counter-measures (legal restrictions, audits, arms-control treaties, detection tools, hardware oversight).  

Inference strategy justification: The source is high-level and qualitative, so moderate inference (confidence 1-2) was used to (i) turn general “we should pass laws” statements into concrete, lifecycle-tagged interventions and (ii) create validation-evidence nodes via historically analogous precedents the author explicitly cites (e.g. surveillance legislation, arms-control success).  No black-box framework nodes were introduced; all reasoning was decomposed into explicit component nodes per instructions.  

Extraction completeness: 36 nodes (≈1 per 140 words) cover every distinct claim that forms a causal chain from the five top-level risks through problem analyses, insights, rationales, mechanisms and evidence to five actionable interventions.  Node names follow the required granularity patterns so they can merge across the 500 k-source corpus.  Edges inter-connect all paths via shared theoretical-insight nodes, producing one fully connected fabric.  No isolated nodes or direct risk→intervention edges remain.  All fields pass the mandatory checklist.  

Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence is often historical analogy, not direct empirical data. 2) Several edges rely on moderate inference because the paper is speculative. 3) Inter-path connections (edges 32-36) reflect conceptual overlap rather than explicit statements, so confidence is low.  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[78] – high structural fidelity; moderate uncertainty from speculative source content.
