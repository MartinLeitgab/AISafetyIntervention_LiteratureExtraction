Summary
The source article argues that artificial neural networks are likely to exhibit “emergent modularity” analogous to functional regions of the brain.  If structural modules in large models reliably implement specific cognitive functions, we could locate and remove (“module-prune”) modules linked to unsafe behaviours such as deception, offensive content or unaligned goal-directed agency, then retrain the model to regain desired capabilities without redeveloping those unsafe traits.  Empirical work on network connectivity clustering (Filan 2021), circuit-level interpretability (Olah 2020) and biological lesion studies provide motivating evidence.

Extraction-confidence [86] – high but not perfect.  The paper is short and speculative, so several causal links rely on medium-strength inference; all such edges are marked with confidence 2-3.  JSON schema and naming rules are rigorously followed; every node is connected and flows from risks → … → interventions.

Inference-strategy justification
Where the paper speculates (e.g. deliberately training agents to misbehave so a removable module forms) I created nodes and edges but assigned low confidence (2) and maturity (1).  All other links directly cite the text.

Extraction completeness
14 concept nodes and 3 intervention nodes capture every distinct claim, method, finding and proposed safety technique in the article, with no isolated nodes.  Multiple validation evidence nodes interconnect the fabric so later sources can merge cleanly.

Key limitations
• Evidence for functional modularity is preliminary; real-world effectiveness of module pruning is untested.  
• Section headers were absent, so “closest preceding section” references use indicative phrase locations.  
• The paper gives no quantitative results, so validation confidences remain medium.

Improvements to instructions
1. Provide explicit guidance on handling sources without section headers—e.g. allow quoting of nearby sentences for node/edge rationales.
2. Clarify whether implementation mechanisms can directly motivate interventions or must always flow through validation evidence.
3. Supply a standard list of acceptable edge verbs with definitions to aid consistency across 500 k sources.
4. Offer examples for assigning confidence scores when evidence is mostly analogical (e.g. biological → artificial).
