          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The paper proposes two distributed‐learning algorithms that enable a network of heterogeneous agents (with different feature dimensions) to cooperate on a binary-classification task.  One algorithm enforces global graph-wide smoothness of predicted labels through a Laplacian regulariser, while the other enforces local neighbourhood smoothness by averaging neighbours’ predictions that share the same true label.  Extensive simulations and a real-world weather dataset show that both cooperative strategies reduce test error compared with non-cooperative training.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  \nInference strategy justification: The source explicitly states risks (poor single-agent accuracy), assumptions (label smoothness), algorithmic design, implementation details and empirical results.  All causal-interventional pathways could therefore be extracted without speculative leaps; only light inference (confidence-level 2) was used to map “testing-time neighbour averaging” to a separate deployment-phase intervention.\n\nExtraction completeness: Every reasoning step that links the top-level risk (“inaccurate classification”) to the three actionable interventions is captured, with 14 nodes (≈1 per 350 words → within guidance) and 23 connecting edges.  Shared nodes (e.g. “Smooth label variation across graph neighbourhoods…”) interconnect both algorithmic branches, ensuring a single coherent fabric.\n\nKey limitations:  \n1. Paper does not quantify safety impacts on high-stakes systems; edges therefore rely on “accuracy improvement” as a proxy for risk reduction.  \n2. Only binary classification considered; generalisation to multi-class or non-smooth scenarios is not captured.  \n3. Validation evidence strength is limited to small-scale simulations and one real dataset (confidence level ≤3).\n\nJSON knowledge fabric below.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\":
