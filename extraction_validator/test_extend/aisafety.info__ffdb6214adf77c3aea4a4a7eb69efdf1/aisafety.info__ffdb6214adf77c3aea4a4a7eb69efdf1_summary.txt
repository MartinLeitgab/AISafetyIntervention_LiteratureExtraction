Summary  
The short data source describes two core strands of CHAI research: (1) Stuart Russell’s “Human Compatible” alignment proposal based on Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) and (2) a paper on “Clusterability in neural networks” that measures model modularity using n-cut graph clustering. Both strands address facets of existential accident risk from advanced AI – mis-specification of goals and inability to interpret model internals. The extracted fabric links these top-level risks through problem analyses, theoretical insights, design rationales, implementation mechanisms and validation evidence, terminating in two concrete interventions: building AGI systems around CIRL with persistent reward uncertainty, and applying n-cut clusterability analysis during model evaluation.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
The paper is brief yet explicit about the key causal stories. All mandatory pathways and connections are present and validated. Confidence is lowered slightly because some nodes rely on light inference to align with the six-stage template (marked with confidence 2).

How the instruction set could be improved  
1. Provide an explicit minimal example for extremely short sources to clarify acceptable levels of inference.  
2. Clarify how to reference “closest preceding data source section title” when the source has no headings—guidance for using paragraph locations would help.  
3. Offer a standard list of acceptable aliases to maximise cross-document merge consistency.

Inference strategy justification  
Light, clearly marked inference filled gaps such as connecting “opaque representations” to safety risk, and elaborating the Bayesian implementation details of CIRL, because the source implicitly assumes these steps.

Extraction completeness explanation  
All distinct claims about risk, mechanism and interventions in the text are represented. Each node is connected; the two branches (alignment & interpretability) converge at the common top-level risk.

Key limitations  
• Empirical support is thin, so most edge confidences are 2–3.  
• The real CIRL literature contains richer validation evidence than the single paragraph captures, so future documents will need merging.
