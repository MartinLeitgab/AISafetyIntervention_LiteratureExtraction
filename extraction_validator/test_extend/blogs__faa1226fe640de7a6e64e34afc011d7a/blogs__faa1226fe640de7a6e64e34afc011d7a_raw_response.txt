          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The May 2019 MIRI newsletter mostly contains brief link-announcements of recently released alignment research, notably Vanessa Kosoy’s SafeML paper on Delegative Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for trap avoidance and Evan Hubinger et al.’s post on defeating Goodhart’s “Closest Unblocked Strategy” (CUBS) problem. Although the newsletter is short and only sketches each work, each link clearly states a motivation, a core proposed solution, and claimed evidence, making it possible—using moderate, explicitly flagged inference—to reconstruct two connected causal-interventional pathways about (1) catastrophic trap states during exploration and (2) reward-misspecification Goodhart effects.  \n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[71]  \nInference strategy justification: Because the newsletter provides only summaries, I filled in standard details (e.g., how DRL delegates when uncertainty exceeds a threshold, or how impact-regularization implements CUBS mitigation) that are widely described in the referenced papers. All such places are marked with confidence 2 and “light inference” in the rationale fields.  \n\nExtraction completeness explanation: All distinct risks, analyses, insights, design rationales, mechanisms, evidences, and interventions explicitly or implicitly present in the links are captured—16 nodes total, ~15 nodes / 5 k words guideline upheld. The two pathways share a causal edge between the two risk nodes, joining them into one connected fabric, and there are no isolated nodes or duplicate concepts.  \n\nKey limitations  \n1. Evidence nodes are necessarily high-level because the newsletter omits experimental detail.  \n2. Some implementation specifics (e.g., delegation oracle thresholds) are inferred, so downstream users should treat maturity ratings as provisional.  \n3. Additional minor research links in the newsletter were omitted to avoid low-confidence speculation; including them would require reading the full referenced posts.  \n\nImprovements to instruction set  \n• Allow an explicit “reference-only summary” evidence confidence code for sources like newsletters that cite, but do not reproduce, experiments.  \n• Permit an edge type such as “is_subrisk_of” for connecting multiple risk nodes more semantically.  \n• Provide a short example of how to handle sparse sources with heavy inference so consistency is maintained across extractors.  \n\n\n```json\n{\n
