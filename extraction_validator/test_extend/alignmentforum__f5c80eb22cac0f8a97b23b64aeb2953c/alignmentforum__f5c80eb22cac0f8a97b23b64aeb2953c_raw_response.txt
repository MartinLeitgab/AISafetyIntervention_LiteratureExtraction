          "text": "Summary  \nThe source is a short conceptual essay arguing that safety-capability trade-off “dials” (alignment tax) are inevitable in advanced AI systems, illustrating several concrete dials and outlining how to minimise their negative impact through technical and governance mechanisms. No empirical data are given; reasoning is mainly theoretical.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[82] – high, because the text is short and conceptual. Remaining uncertainty comes from having to do light inference to turn the author’s examples (sandbox testing, humans-in-loop, resource limits, etc.) into explicit interventions and to add a governance mechanism implementation node so that every path follows the mandatory category order.\n\nHow the instruction set could be improved  \nThe current rules require the strict seven-step concept chain even when a paper is entirely conceptual and skips some steps (e.g. gives no validation evidence). Allowing “implicit validation evidence” or permitting the chain to omit one category when the source clearly lacks it would reduce forced low-confidence inference nodes. Explicit examples of governance/policy implementation mechanisms would help too.\n\nInference strategy justification  \n• Added a “Governance and legal frameworks enforcing alignment tax compliance” implementation node so that the policy intervention fits the mandatory ordering.  \n• Treated the author’s qualitative arguments (“it would help more than zero”) as a single low-confidence validation evidence node for all mechanisms.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation  \nAll risks, explanatory assumptions, design rationales and every concrete mechanism mentioned are captured; each is connected to a downstream intervention. No isolated nodes remain.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Validation evidence is entirely theoretical; confidence scores are hence low (2).  \n• The governance path is lightly inferred, because the author only calls for “some coordination mechanism”.  \n• The essay is short; resulting fabric is correspondingly small.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Catastrophic AGI accidents via
