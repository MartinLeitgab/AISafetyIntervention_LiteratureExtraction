Data-source overview (LessWrong post, ~800 words):  
The author proposes using AIXI’s “anvil problem” as a feature, intentionally giving an Oracle-style AI absolute certainty that it is epiphenomenal.  Combined with Causal Decision Theory (CDT), the AI would not expect its actions (including box-breaking exploits) to influence the outside world and hence would not try to escape.  The post also notes a residual risk of harmful or self-fulfilling answers and points to separate answer-safety mechanisms (e.g. Armstrong 2017) as a remedy.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Inference strategy: The text is conceptual; I extracted explicit reasoning steps and stitched them into the mandated risk→…→intervention flow, using modest inference (confidence 2) where the post is informal.  
Completeness: Every distinct claim used to justify containment or answer-safety was mapped; paths share nodes, forming a single connected fabric.  
Key limitations: 1) Only thought experiments—no empirical validation—so many edge confidences are 2-3. 2) Some edges (“enabled_by”, “specified_by”) reflect logical flow rather than explicit wording.

The instruction set could improve by:  
• Supplying a short glossary of preferred edge verbs with examples for each category to reduce ambiguity.  
• Clarifying whether “enabled_by” should point from earlier to later or vice-versa (the template mixes directions).  
• Allowing “conceptual thought experiment” as a recognised validation-evidence strength distinct from empirical studies.



Key limitations: The source lacks empirical work, so confidence values remain moderate; real deployment would need stronger validation.
