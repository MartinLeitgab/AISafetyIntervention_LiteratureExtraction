Summary  
Data source overview: The essay proposes that controlling AGI requires prior understanding of the learning-algorithm architecture it will employ. It introduces a three-axis framework—foundational learning algorithm (SL, RL, or unknown), post-deployment learning capacity (offline ↔ online), and level of general intelligence (sub-, human-, or super-human)—to locate candidate AGI designs and guide safety work. Illustrative examples (Tesla Autopilot vs. human brain) show how today’s systems sit in that space.  
Report EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[77] – Reasonably high confidence in node/edge correctness and JSON syntax; lower confidence stems from the purely conceptual nature of the source (little empirical evidence) and the need for moderate inference when formulating interventions.  
Inference strategy justification: Because the paper is programmatic rather than prescriptive, explicit interventions are sparse. Following instructions, I inferred three plausible, low-maturity interventions (framework adoption, research prioritisation, architecture-specific controls) directly implied by the author’s reasoning; all such edges are marked with confidence-level 2.  
Extraction completeness explanation: All causal chains from the single top-level risk through the three major problem analyses, the central theoretical insight, two design rationales, one implementation mechanism, a piece of validation evidence, and three actionable interventions are captured and interconnected, forming one coherent fabric with no isolated nodes.  
Key limitations: 1) Validation evidence is illustrative, so confidence scores are low. 2) Interventions are inferred and abstract, reflecting early-stage maturity. 3) The framework’s axes are condensed into single nodes to avoid over-fragmentation; future instructions could clarify desired granularity for multi-axis taxonomies.



Improvements to instruction set: Clarify desired edge semantics between categories (e.g., whether ‘caused_by’ or ‘mitigated_by’ should connect problem analysis ↔ theoretical insight) to reduce ambiguity; provide guidance on handling highly conceptual sources with few explicit interventions; include examples of acceptable inference for intervention granularity.
