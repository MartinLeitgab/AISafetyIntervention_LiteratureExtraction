Summary  
Data-source overview: The paper introduces Helpa, an instructible agent that lets non-technical end-users teach virtual assistants new non-branching tasks from a single demonstration.  It formalises the IA problem, presents a strongly-biased one-shot learning model, details architecture and learning algorithm, reports an 85 % task-completion usability study (<1 min training per task) and analyses current limitations (no paraphrasing, no adjacent variables).  

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[86]  
– High confidence in node/edge correctness and JSON validity.  
– Lowered by inevitably subjective mapping of HCI research to the AI-safety-oriented ontology and moderate inference needed for future improvements.  

Instruction-set improvement: Allow an explicit “limitation evidence” category; clarify preferred direction of edge verbs; provide examples where multiple problem-analysis nodes feed one theoretical insight; add short glossary of edge semantics.  

Inference strategy justification  
Where the paper proposes future work implicitly (e.g. adding paraphrase generation) I created intervention nodes, marking maturity 1 and assigning low confidence (2) edges.  All other nodes are based on explicit statements or quantitative study results.  

Extraction completeness explanation  
Every claim that participates in the causal chain from unmet user needs (risk) through model/algorithm design to usability findings and deployment/future improvements is represented.  Nodes that could not be connected were excluded, so the fabric is fully connected.  

Key limitations  
– The source is HCI-oriented; direct AI-safety relevance is indirect (improving reliability and customisability).  
– Some edge directions rely on qualitative reasoning rather than explicit causal wording.  
– Future-work interventions are inferred, hence low confidence.
