          "text": "Summary  \nData source overview: The May 2013 MIRI newsletter summarizes several newly-released technical papers, blog analyses and organisational updates. Core themes include the risk of an uncontrolled intelligence explosion, difficulties in forecasting AGI arrival, the need for trustworthy (“Friendly”) AI architectures, and MIRI’s strategy of cultivating expert networks and formal models to mitigate existential AI risk.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[64] – The newsletter is a high-level summary rather than a single technical report, so many links are indirect; nevertheless, all explicit causal-interventional reasoning chains were captured and lightly supplemented with clearly-marked low-confidence inferences where needed.\n\nInference strategy justification: Whenever the newsletter pointed to external work (e.g. Timeless Decision Theory, DAGGRE forecasting) I treated those works’ core mechanisms as implementation nodes and kept confidence values low when the newsletter only implied, rather than demonstrated, empirical support.\n\nExtraction completeness explanation: Every top-level AI-safety risk mentioned (existential catastrophe from unaligned AGI and strategic mis-preparedness) is connected, through all intermediate concept categories, to every actionable intervention suggested or implied (ROI modelling, TDT research, DAGGRE participation, advisor recruitment). No nodes remain unconnected and no intervention is linked directly to a risk node.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Empirical validation evidence is thin in the newsletter, so several validation nodes rely on indirect or historical data, reflected in confidence scores 2–3.  \n• Interventions are research-oriented rather than concrete engineering controls, so lifecycle stages are marked “6-Other” or “1-Model Design”.  \n• Some node descriptions reference external documents only summarised in the newsletter; richer primary sources would allow higher confidence extractions.\n\nPossible instruction-set improvements  \n1. Allow an “evidence gap” flag so extraction can indicate when a source references but does not provide data, reducing reliance on low-confidence validation nodes.  \n2. Provide an approved list of edge verbs for “analysed_by” or “clarified_by”, which often fits better than “addressed_by” in risk-analysis flows.  \n3. Explicitly state how to handle newsletters or meta-summaries that aggregate many primary sources.\n\nJSON knowledge fabric follows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Existential
