Summary
Data source overview:  
The note argues that the famous impossibility result of Gibbard (1973) only applies to voting systems that take rank-ordered lists as input.  Because modern machine-learning systems operate on high-dimensional latent-space vectors, the author suggests that strategy-proof voting might be achievable if ballots are expressed as such vectors and aggregated with clustering techniques that naturally discard strategic outliers.  Two concrete research directions are proposed: (1) design an actual latent-space modal voting algorithm and (2) attempt a new impossibility proof for vector ballots.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[79]  
Inference strategy justification:  The text is largely conceptual and speculative.  I extracted explicit causal links (e.g. “Gibbard ⇒ strategic manipulation”) and introduced modest, marked inference (confidence 2) to bridge to the suggested interventions (designing / proving).  
Extraction completeness explanation:  Every distinct claim that participates in the reasoning chain from the top-level risk (inefficient collective decision making) to the author’s proposed interventions is represented.  All nodes are connected in a single fabric and no intervention links directly to a risk.  
Key limitations:  No empirical results are provided, so validation evidence is indirect.  Lifecycle and maturity assessments are therefore low.  Names may still evolve as the literature on vector-ballot voting matures.
