Because modern machine-learning systems operate on high-dimensional latent-space vectors, the author suggests that strategy-proof voting might be achievable if ballots are expressed as such vectors and aggregated with clustering techniques that naturally discard strategic outliers.  Two concrete research directions are proposed: (1) design an actual latent-space modal voting algorithm and (2) attempt a new impossibility proof for vector ballots.\n\nEXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[79]  \nInference strategy justification:  The text is largely conceptual and speculative.  I extracted explicit causal links (e.g. “Gibbard ⇒ strategic manipulation”) and introduced modest, marked inference (confidence 2) to bridge to the suggested interventions (designing / proving).  \nExtraction completeness explanation:  Every distinct claim that participates in the reasoning chain from the top-level risk (inefficient collective decision making) to the author’s proposed interventions is represented.  All nodes are connected in a single fabric and no intervention links directly to a risk.  \nKey limitations:  No empirical results are provided, so validation evidence is indirect.  Lifecycle and maturity assessments are therefore low.  Names may still evolve as the literature on vector-ballot voting matures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Inefficient collective decisions from strategic voting in rank-list elections\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"resource misallocation due to strategic voting\", \"poor policy outcomes from manipulated ballots\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"When voters can benefit from insincere ranking, elected options can diverge from true social welfare, leading to inefficiency at large scales (e.g., governmental budgeting).\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"risk\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Sets the top-level harm the entire discussion seeks to remedy (Purpose! section).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Strategic manipulation inevitability under Gibbard's theorem for ranked ballots\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"Gibbard impossibility for rank lists\", \"unavoidable gaming in ordinal voting\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Gibbard-Satterthwaite shows that with ≥3 alternatives any nondictatorial voting rule using ranked lists is vulnerable to beneficial mis-reporting by voters.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"problem analysis\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Explains the mechanism causing the risk (Gibbard’s Theorem section).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Latent-space vector ballots retaining relational preference information\",\n      \"aliases\": [\"high-dimensional preference embeddings\", \"vector representations of voter intent\"],\n      \"type\": \"concept\",\n      \"description\": \"Unlike rank lists that compress preferences into an ordering, latent vectors preserve multiple relational dimensions, potentially avoiding information loss that enables manipulation.\",\n      \"concept_category\": \"theoretical insight\",\n      \"intervention_lifecycle\": null,\n      \"intervention_lifecycle_rationale\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity\": null,\n      \"intervention_maturity_rationale\": null,\n      \"node_rationale\": \"Core hypothesis that a different data type may evade the impossibility (TL;DR & Some Hope?
