## 1. Analysis Clarity & Precision  

| Aspect | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
|Paper alignment|Captures major findings (accuracy, speed, over-reliance, contrastive fixes, retrieval recall) and lists limitations. |Same coverage; also mentions grounding effect. |Both omit a few details (e.g., exact #participants; time-on-task stats for contrastive condition).|
|Inference strategy declared?|Yes – explicitly tags “inferred_theoretical” interventions. |Yes, but later assigns maturity = 3 “tested” to interventions that are only evaluated in paper (should be 4).|
|Clarity & readability|Well-structured bullet lists; concise. |Readable but denser; longer sentences.|
|Cross-run terminology stability|Node titles similar, but edge labels differ (`mitigated_by` vs `mitigates`; extra types like `addressed_by`, `implies`). Maturity values differ (tested = 4 vs 3).|Terminology and numeric scales inconsistent across runs.|

**Verdict:** Both summaries are faithful and clear, but cross-run consistency is weak and Analysis 2 mis-uses maturity numbers.

## 2. Logical-Chain Reasoning  

| Criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 | Issues (both) |
|---|---|---|---|
|Complete causal coverage|Includes main chains (over-reliance, retrieval recall, adaptive UI). Misses user-confidence chain.|Adds confidence-calibration chain. Generally good but still omits “contrastive hurts when explanation correct” causal effect.|Minor omissions (participant factors, time trade-off chain from contrastive).|
|Node uniqueness & definitions|Distinct nodes, clear descriptions.|Similar quality.|Duplicate semantics across analyses but acceptable.|
|Intervention decomposition|No `implemented_by` edges (multi-step interventions collapsed).|Same.|Non-compliant with guideline.|
|Allowed edge types|Uses `contributes_to`, `mitigated_by` (OK) **but also** `implies`, `addressed_by`.|Uses several non-allowed types (`mitigates`, `enabled_by`, `resolved_by`, etc.).|Schema drift in both, worse in Analysis 2.|
|Edge confidence present & numeric|Numeric 1-2 mostly; rationale provided.|Numeric 2-4, but “4 established” used where evidence is only “supported”.|Scale often inflated; “established” requires replication.|
|Intervention maturity numeric|Yes; values 1,4. Matches scale.|Yes; but mis-matched (uses 3 for “tested”, 4 for “deployed”).|Inconsistent interpretation across runs.|
|Concept maturity omitted|Correct (null).|Correct.|—|

**Verdict:** Both analyses violate edge-type constraints and lack decomposition; Analysis 2 has larger schema drift and scale misuse.

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses  

| | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|
|Analysis 1|• Faithful summary.  • Explicit inference tags.  • All nodes list descriptions, aliases.  • Numeric confidence & maturity present. |• Invalid edge types (`implies`, `addressed_by`).  • No `implemented_by`.  • Confidence scale conservative but still subjective.  • Cross-run terminology instability.|
|Analysis 2|• Adds additional causal chain on confidence calibration.  • Rich rationale texts. |• Multiple non-allowed edge types (`mitigates`, `enabled_by`, etc.).  • Maturity scale mis-used (tested=3).  • Edge confidences inflated.  • Same missing `implemented_by`.  • Terminology drift vs Analysis 1.|

## 4. Recommendations for Improvement  

1. **Restrict edge types** to the allowed set; remap `implies`, `mitigates`, `enabled_by`, etc.  
2. **Add `implemented_by` decomposition** for complex interventions (e.g., “Adaptive interface” → sub-steps: confidence estimation, UI toggle).  
3. **Harmonise numeric scales**:  
   • Intervention maturity: tested = 4, deployed = 5.  
   • Edge confidence: keep within 1–3 for paper evidence; reserve 4–5 for replicated/proven results.  
4. **Merge overlapping nodes** across runs (e.g., “Users over-trust…”). Use stable IDs and wording.  
5. **Provide two consistent generations**: same node names, edge labels, scales.  
6. **Add missing chains**: trade-off of contrastive explanations when explanation is already correct; sample-size limitations.  
7. **Clarify inference provenance**: mark every inferred edge/intervention explicitly in node or edge metadata.
