Analyses under review

## 1. Analysis Clarity & Precision

| Sub-criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Paper alignment** | Captures main finding (persuasion-based jail-breaks succeed) and notes model variance. Mentions four of the five persuasion principles, limitations, lack of mitigations. Misses discussion of experimental methodology details (number of scenarios, qualitative nature). | Similar coverage; explicitly lists all five studied principles and same limitations. Omits the paper’s claim that deception techniques are “effective to lure LLMs” in *all* but one model. |
| **Inference strategy declared?** | Yes. States that interventions are *inferred_theoretical* because paper proposes none. | Yes, same strategy stated. |
| **Clarity & readability** | Well-structured bullets. Some verbosity but largely clear. | Equally clear, slightly more concise. |
| **Cross-run consistency** | Terminology, node names, confidence labels (“speculative”, “supported”) are identical. However numeric scales still absent in both runs (see §2). | Same issues; so internally consistent with Analysis 1 but not with required scheme. |

**Verdict:** Both are readable and broadly faithful, but neither references all paper details and both omit numeric scale compliance.

## 2. Logical-Chain Reasoning

| Checkpoint | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Completeness of causal coverage** | Models only one causal starting point (LLM susceptibility) and five high-level chains. Omits explicit chain for each of the five deception techniques individually and the “direct-prompt vs deceptive-prompt” comparison table in the paper. | Same coverage; slightly more detail on RLHF bias, but still omits technique-by-technique chains and experimental design node. |
| **Node uniqueness & definitions** | No obvious duplicates; definitions present. | Same quality. |
| **Intervention decomposition** | Multi-step interventions (“red-teaming ➜ retraining”) are *not* split with `implemented_by`; instead uses `enables`. Violates schema. | Same issue (uses `enables`). |
| **Edge types & flow** | Uses many un-permitted edge labels (`addressed_by`, `enables`, `contrasts_with`, `implies`, `motivates`, `resolved_by`). Required set not respected. | Same problem; uses `implies`, `addressed_by`, etc. |
| **Confidence & maturity** | • Edge confidence expressed as text (“speculative”, “supported”) not numeric 1-5.  
• Intervention maturity is numeric (1) but the scale description is missing.  
• Concepts incorrectly carry no maturity (OK). | Identical deficiencies. |
| **Schema compliance overall** | Broken on edge vocabulary and numeric confidence. | Same. |

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses

| Aspect | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Strengths** | • Clear prose and rationale for inferred interventions.  
• Node list includes aliases & descriptions. | • Slightly leaner summary; adds RLHF bias concept.  
• Same metadata richness. |
| **Weaknesses** | • Non-compliant edge types.  
• Confidence not numeric.  
• No `implemented_by`.  
• Some key causal chains (per deception tactic) missing. | • Repeats all weaknesses of Analysis 1.  
• Adds new non-compliant edge `addressed_by`. |

## 4. Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Replace ad-hoc edge labels** with allowed ones:  
   • `causes`, `contributes_to`, `mitigated_by`, `implemented_by`.  
   Map current usages (`enables`, `implies`, `motivates`, etc.) to these four or justify via extension notice.
2. **Provide numeric confidence (1–5)** for every edge; include legend in JSON or text.
3. **Add `implemented_by` chains** to break down complex interventions (e.g., “Red-team suite” *implemented_by* “Generate persuasion prompt corpus”, “Automated executor”, etc.).
4. **Model each deception principle explicitly**: create five concept nodes (Authority etc.) that *contribute_to* filter bypass; show separate paths.
5. **Include missing causal context** such as “Lack of systematic testing” ➜ “Limited generalisability”.
6. **State confidence/maturity scales once** and use identical numeric values across runs to prove cross-run stability.
7. **Reduce alias redundancy** and ensure each node appears only once across chains.
