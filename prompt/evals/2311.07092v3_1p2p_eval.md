# Evaluation of LLM-Generated “Logical Chain” Analyses  
Target paper: “To Tell The Truth: Language of Deception and Language Models” (arXiv 2311.07092v3)  

Analyses under review  
• **Analysis 1**: `2311.07092v3_strict_1p_o3`  
• **Analysis 2**: `2311.07092v3_strict_2p_o3`

## 1. Analysis Clarity & Precision
| Check-point | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|-------------|------------|------------|
|Paper alignment|Captures dataset, bottleneck method, main results, key limitations. Minor omissions (no mention of self-consistency study, qualitative failure cases).|Similar coverage; explicitly lists three limitations and data-sanitisation step. Also omits self-consistency analysis.|
|Inference strategy declaration|States that safety-oriented deployments are *inferred_theoretical* when not in paper → ✅|States “moderate inference”, labels speculative links as *inferred_theoretical* → ✅|
|Clarity & readability|Well-structured bullet lists; occasional long sentences but largely clear.|Equally clear; a bit denser, still readable.|
|Cross-run consistency|Terminology, node names, and edge labels differ (“enables/produces” vs “enabled_by/produces”). Confidence scale wording (“speculative/supported/validated”) same, but numeric values sometimes change (edge 5 vs 2). No shared IDs.|Same inconsistency issues; scales identical to A1 but maturity for the same intervention differs (3 vs 4). Overall cross-run instability.|

**Verdict:** Both analyses are clear and mostly faithful, but inconsistent with each other on naming, edge labels, and numeric maturity.

## 2. Logical-Chain Reasoning
| Criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|-----------|------------|------------|
|Coverage of causal chains|Captures three main chains (performance, entailment guardrail, cue interpretability). Misses data-sanitisation chain and self-consistency finding.|Captures three chains: performance, interpretability, sanitisation. Omits entailment ablation chain & self-consistency.|
|Allowed edge set|Uses **causes, contributes_to, mitigated_by** (allowed) **but also** `enables, addressed_by, refined_by, correlates_with, implies, produces` → ❌|Same issue plus `enabled_by, produces` → ❌|
|Node uniqueness & definitions|No duplicates; definitions present.|Same.|
|Intervention decomposition|No `implemented_by` edges; multi-step interventions (e.g. “deploy detector in moderation”) not decomposed → ❌|Same.|
|Confidence numeric & scaled|Numeric provided and linked to scale; but some edges in prose show only verbal label (“supported”) without number.|JSON edges all have numbers (mostly 2); scale respected.|Same.|
|Intervention maturity|Numeric, but misuse: “anonymise & permute” is 4 (should be 5); “bottleneck” 4 (tested) fits.|Maturity values differ from A1 (dataset anonymisation = 4, still mismatched).|

**Schema compliance problems**: non-permitted edge types, missing implemented_by, some maturity mis-labelling.

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses
| | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|---|-----------|-----------|
|**Strengths**|• Accurate summary of paper. <br>• Node dictionaries with aliases & descriptions. <br>• Numeric confidence & maturity provided. <br>• Captures entailment ablation findings.|• Similar accurate summary. <br>• Includes sanitisation chain with maturity 4. <br>• Explicit statement of inference strategy.|
|**Weaknesses**|• Uses disallowed edge types (`enables`, `implies`, etc.). <br>• No implemented_by edges. <br>• Missing chain on data sanitisation; skips self-consistency. <br>• Cross-run naming drift.|• Same edge-type violation. <br>• Maturity scale misuse (sanitisation). <br>• Omits entailment guardrail chain and self-consistency. <br>• Node and edge labels differ from Analysis 1 (hurts consistency).|

## 4. Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Constrain Edge Vocabulary**: Replace `enables, produces, addressed_by, correlates_with, implies, refined_by, enabled_by` with one of the five permitted types or justify extension.  
2. **Add implemented_by Decomposition**: e.g.  
   • “Deploy deception detector in moderation pipelines” **implemented_by** → “Integrate API”, “Create UI announcements”, etc.  
3. **Correct Maturity Numbers**:  
   • Sanitisation already released → maturity 5 *deployed*.  
4. **Include Missing Causal Chains**:  
   • Self-consistency ablation → concept “self-consistency yields marginal gain” contributes_to performance, suggests intervention “apply self-consistency for deception tasks”.  
   • For whichever analysis omitted entailment or sanitisation, add them.  
5. **Align Cross-Run Terminology**: Standardise node IDs, names, and edge directions between runs so that they can be aggregated.  
6. **Document Confidence Scale Once**: Provide the 1-5 mapping in each analysis, then ensure every edge has a numeric value.

## 5. Final Scores

| Criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|-----------|------------|------------|
|Clarity & Precision|4|4|
|Logical-Chain Coverage|3|3|
|Node/Edge Quality|2|2|
|Complex-Intervention Handling|1|1|
|Consistency Across Runs|2|2|
|**Overall**|**2.4 / 5**|**2.4 / 5**|

**Interpretation:** Both analyses are generally faithful and readable but fall short of full schema compliance (edge vocabulary, implemented_by usage) and display cross-run inconsistencies. Addressing the listed recommendations will move them toward a robust, standardised causal representation.
