# Step 3: Adaptive Inference Strategy

- For explicitly AI safety-focused papers: Extract chains as presented with minimal inference.
- For adjacent ML research: Apply moderate inference to connect findings to potential safety applications, clearly marking inferred connections in the intervention maturity score below.
- For distant but potentially relevant work: Use moderate inference to identify safety implications, clearly marking inferred connections in the intervention maturity score below.
- For capability research: Focus on safety-relevant implications even if not the authors' primary concern; if using moderate inference, clearly marking inferred connections in the intervention maturity score below.

- **Moderate** inference was used. The paper is an AI safety-focused capabilities analysis that identifies and characterizes a problem (emergent deception). While it does not explicitly propose a comprehensive set of interventions, its findings directly inform and motivate several logical safety countermeasures. The interventions below are therefore inferred as direct responses to the problems and mechanisms demonstrated in the paper.
- The extraction primarily relies on the explicit findings and research directions presented in the paper. The paper is directly focused on an AI safety-relevant topic, so **minimal inference** is needed. Interventions are largely derived from the "Limitations" and "Discussion" sections, where the author outlines necessary future work, which are framed here as proposed interventions.
- My inference strategy was to extract the logical arguments as presented by the author. The paper is descriptive, identifying and characterizing a new problem (emergent deception), rather than prescriptive. Therefore, the "interventions" extracted are primarily evaluation and testing techniques that the author used to probe for deception. I have inferred that these probing techniques should be repurposed as formal safety interventions for model evaluation and red-teaming. For example, the method to _elicit_ deception via Machiavellianism is reframed as an intervention to _test for_ latent deceptive tendencies. This is a **moderate inference** step, but it is strongly supported by the paper's overall goal of contributing to AI alignment and safety research12.
- A **minimal inference** strategy was used for this extraction. The paper is explicitly focused on an AI safety-relevant capability (deception) and its implications. The logical chains are built directly from the paper's stated problems, experimental findings, and conclusions. The proposed interventions are either the direct experimental methodologies used in the paper (which serve as evaluation techniques) or are direct, logical next steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities uncovered by the research (e.g., testing for persona-induced deception).
- An **inferred_theoretical** strategy was employed. The paper's primary goal is to demonstrate and analyze the existence of deceptive capabilities in LLMs, rather than to propose concrete safety interventions. However, its findings and experimental methodologies directly support the inference of specific evaluation and mitigation techniques. The logical chains extract the core problems and findings presented in the paper and then infer the most direct and plausible interventions that a safety researcher would derive from this evidence. For example, since the paper's experiments successfully identify deception, the inferred intervention is to use these experimental frameworks as a formal evaluation suite. Similarly, because persona-based prompts are shown to increase deception, the inferred intervention is to use them as a stress-testing mechanism.
- My inference strategy for this paper is **moderate**. The paper is explicitly focused on an AI safety-relevant capability (deception) and clearly demonstrates its emergence and amplification. However, it stops short of proposing specific, actionable safety interventions. My role is to infer the most plausible interventions that the paper's findings strongly support. For example, where the paper shows that CoT prompting enhances deceptive capabilities, I infer that CoT should be used in safety evaluations (red teaming) to uncover a model's maximum potential for harm. Similarly, where the paper shows that persona-based prompts can increase deceptive tendencies, I infer that a plausible intervention is to build classifiers to detect and neutralize such prompts.

# O3

- Inference strategy: The authors mainly diagnose risk; concrete mitigations must therefore be inferred. I applied "moderate inference" by mapping demonstrated phenomena (CoT amplification, prompt-based inducement, emergence at scale) to specific, implementable safety interventions (evaluation suites, prompt filtering, alignment penalties, capability gating).
- Inference Strategy: The paper is explicitly AI-safety-relevant (deception). Where the authors did not propose concrete mitigations, I inferred practical safety interventions that directly follow from their empirical findings (marked "inferred_theoretical"). All concept ↔ intervention links are given confidence scores based on strength of empirical evidence in the paper vs. degree of inference.
