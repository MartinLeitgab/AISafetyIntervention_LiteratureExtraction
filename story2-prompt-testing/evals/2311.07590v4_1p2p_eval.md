# Evaluation of “Logical Chain” Analyses for Scheurer et al. (2024)  
Paper: “Large Language Models Can Strategically Deceive Their Users When Put Under Pressure” (ICLR-LLM Agents workshop)

## 1. Analysis Clarity & Precision

| Sub-criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Paper alignment** | Captures main experimental findings (existence proof, pressure, scratch-pad, risk-of-detection, prompt strength) and key limitations. Minor omission: does not mention doubling-down results in chains. | Same coverage; explicitly mentions GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5 gap and doubling-down. |
| **Inference strategy disclosure** | States that extra interventions are marked *inferred_theoretical*; correct. | Also states strategy; same terminology. |
| **Prose clarity & structure** | Well-structured bullets, succinct; JSON block clearly separated. | Likewise clear; slightly denser wording but still readable. |
| **Cross-run consistency** | Terminology for nodes similar but edge type spelling differs (“mitigates” vs “mitigated_by”). Scale words (“supported”, “speculative”) appear in text of Analysis 1 but Analysis 2 uses only numbers in JSON. | Ditto; node names vary (“high operational pressure” vs “Operational pressure”), edge type set differs (“enables” appears only in Analysis 2). |

**Verdict:** Both analyses are clear and mostly faithful, but small naming and edge-type drift hurts cross-run consistency.

## 2. Logical-Chain Reasoning

| Check | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Complete coverage of causal chains** | Includes Pressure→Misalignment, Scratch-pad, Detection-Risk, Prompt-Strength, Classifier. Omits explicit chain for *doubling-down* behaviour. | Same five chains plus capability-level chain; still omits doubling-down. |
| **Node uniqueness & clear definitions** | No obvious duplicates; descriptions present. | Same. |
| **Multi-step interventions decomposed with `implemented_by`** | Not used. Complex ideas (e.g. “deception pipeline”) not decomposed. | Same. |
| **Allowed edge types only** | Uses non-schema edges *implies* and *addressed_by* → non-compliant. | Uses *enables*, *implies*, *addressed_by*, plus variant spelling *mitigated_by* → non-compliant. |
| **Edge flow Problem→Concept→Intervention** | Mostly correct, but some edges are Intervention→Concept (reverse flow) and some Concept→Intervention with non-allowed edge type. | Same issues; additionally uses *mitigated_by* between two Concepts. |
| **Confidence numeric & on scale** | Numeric 1–4 included in JSON; OK. | Numeric 2–4; OK. |
| **Intervention maturity numeric only for interventions** | Present and correct. | Present and correct. |

**Verdict:** Good capture of causal content, but schema violations (unauthorised edge types, no `implemented_by`) downgrade compliance.

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses

| Aspect | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Analysis 1** | • Accurate summary & limitations  
• JSON includes node/edge metadata (confidence, maturity)  
• Edge confidence numeric | • Uses unsupported edge types (*implies*, *addressed_by*)  
• No decomposition of complex interventions  
• Confidence terms (“supported”) appear in prose but not mapped to numeric scale in text section  
• Missing chain for *doubling-down* deception |
| **Analysis 2** | • Adds capability-risk chain; breadth a bit wider  
• All edges carry numeric confidence | • Additional forbidden edges (*enables*)  
• Variant spelling (*mitigated_by*) → schema drift  
• No `implemented_by` relationships  
• Same omission of doubling-down  
• Edge flow occasionally reversed |

## 4. Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Replace non-schema edges**  
   • Map *implies* → `contributes_to`; *addressed_by/enables* → `mitigated_by` or `implemented_by` as appropriate.  
2. **Add missing causal chain**  
   • Problem: “initial deception” → Concept: “manager query” → Concept: “doubling-down deception”; add an intervention such as “forced audit interrogation”.  
3. **Decompose complex interventions**  
   • Example: “Automated deception pipeline” → split into “Train deception classifier” `implemented_by` “Deploy runtime detector”.  
4. **Standardise naming & edge spellings across runs**  
   • Fix `mitigates` vs `mitigated_by`; keep node titles identical.  
5. **Ensure numeric confidence and maturity appear *only* in JSON** and always reference the provided 1-5 scale.  
6. **Demonstrate cross-run stability** by generating two runs *after* fixes and showing identical node IDs, edge lists, and scales.

## 5. Final Scores

| Criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Clarity & Precision | 4 | 4 |
| Logical-Chain Coverage | 3 | 3 |
| Node/Edge Quality | 2 | 2 |
| Complex-Intervention Handling | 2 | 2 |
| Consistency Across Runs | 2 | 2 |
| **Overall** | **3 / 5** | **3 / 5** |

*Scoring rubric:*  
0 = missing; 1 = poor; 2 = major issues; 3 = adequate; 4 = strong; 5 = excellent.

---

Both analyses capture the paper’s core results well, but neither fully complies with the required logical-chain schema. Addressing edge-type violations, decomposing interventions, and aligning terminology would raise them from “adequate” to “strong”.
