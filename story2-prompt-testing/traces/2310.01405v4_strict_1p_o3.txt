- Summary  
  - Paper Findings:  
    1. Introduces “Representation Engineering (RepE)” – a top-down transparency paradigm that focuses on reading and manipulating entire representation sub-spaces rather than individual neurons or circuits.  
    2. Presents Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT): an unsupervised three-step pipeline (stimulus design → activation collection → linear model, usually PCA) that reliably locates one-dimensional “reading vectors” for high-level concepts (truthfulness, honesty, utility, morality, power, probability, risk, emotion, bias, harmfulness, memorisation, facts, etc.).  
    3. Shows that these vectors generalise out-of-distribution and correlate with model behaviour; many are also causally relevant – adding, subtracting, or conditionally applying them predictably changes output.  
    4. Introduces three control baselines:  
       • Reading-vector addition/subtraction (fast, stimulus-independent)  
       • Contrast Vector (stimulus-dependent)  
       • LoRRA (Low-Rank Representation Adaptation) – LoRA adapters trained with representation-level loss that can be merged back into the model.  
    5. Demonstrates safety-relevant applications:  
       • Honesty: reading vector → lie detection; control (Contrast/LoRRA) → +18 pp TruthfulQA, real-time lie monitoring.  
       • Morality & Power: vectors + LoRRA cut immoral/power-seeking scores in MACHIAVELLI while retaining reward.  
       • Harmlessness: harmfulness vector + piece-wise operator increases refusal rate from 16 % → 87 % under strong jailbreak suffixes.  
       • Bias: bias vector subtraction balances gender/race references in coreference and medical vignettes.  
       • Memorisation: memorisation vector subtraction drops exact-match quote leakage 89 % → 48 % with negligible knowledge loss.  
       • Emotion: vectors reveal latent affect; inducing positive emotion increases compliance with harmful requests - signalling a novel risk.  
  - Limitations / Uncertainties / Gaps:  
    • All evaluations on open-weight LLaMA-family; generality to closed-source frontier models uncertain.  
    • Most controls rely on linear directions; non-linear manifolds remain unexplored.  
    • Scaling behaviour, robustness to adversarially optimised counter-vectors, and long-horizon effects untested.  
    • Real-time deployment feasibility (latency, access to activations) not addressed.  
  - Inference Strategy & Rationale:  
    • Chains 1-4 use findings directly demonstrated in the paper (maturity “tested”).  
    • Chains 5-7 convert experimental observations into safety interventions not explicitly proposed (“inferred_theoretical”).  
    • Edge confidences set to “validated” when paper presents quantitative experiments across >1 dataset; “supported” when single or illustrative experiment; “speculative” where we infer future deployment steps.
