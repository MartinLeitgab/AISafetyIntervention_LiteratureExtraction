- Summary  
	- Paper Findings:  
	  1. Introduces T4TEXT, a 150-session conversational dataset from the 1950s TV game-show “To Tell The Truth” where one real “central contestant” (CC) tries to answer truthfully while two imposters lie.  Each session supplies an affidavit that contains objective ground-truth facts.  
	  2. Shows that text-only linguistic cues (entailment against affidavit, ambiguity, overconfidence, half-truths) are sufficient for detecting deceptive speakers at close-to-human accuracy (39 % vs 41 %).  
	  3. Presents a “bottleneck” framework: per-snippet LLMs first predict the four cues, then a discriminator LLM reasons over the cue sequence.  This outperforms base or chain-of-thought prompting and provides more interpretable rationales.  
	  4. Half-truth detection is empirically the most important cue; removing it drops accuracy by 7 %.  
	  5. The LLM detector succeeds in many cases where all human judges fail, and its explanations are preferred by annotators.  
	  6. Authors argue for human-AI collaboration: people could learn new deception indicators from the model’s explicit cue-based explanations.  
	- Limitations / Uncertainties:  
	  • Dataset is small (86 k words, 150 games) and from a historical context; linguistic style and deception patterns may differ today.  
	  • Only English, four fixed cues; multimodal signals excluded; external validity uncertain.  
	  • Evaluation in research setting; no real-world deployment or adversarial pressure tested.  
	- Inference Strategy:  
	  • Moderate inference: Paper is not explicitly about “AI safety” but about deception detection.  I connect their findings to safety-relevant interventions such as monitoring LLM outputs for deceptive language, improving interpretability, and reducing misinformation.  Maturity scores reflect that most safety uses are inferred whereas the bottleneck framework itself is empirically tested in the paper.
