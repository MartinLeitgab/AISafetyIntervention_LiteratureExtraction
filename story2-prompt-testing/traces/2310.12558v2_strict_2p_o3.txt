Summary
- Paper Findings: The study compares five assistance modes for human fact-checking of Wikipedia-based claims: (1) no assistance, (2) top-10 retrieved passages, (3) single-sided LLM (ChatGPT) explanation, (4) contrastive explanation (ChatGPT arguments for and against the claim shown side-by-side), and (5) retrieval + explanation. Explanations and retrieval each raise accuracy from 59 % to ≈ 74 %, but explanations are > 2× faster. When the explanation is wrong (≈ 22 % of cases), humans “over-rely” and their accuracy falls to 35 %, below both baseline and retrieval. Contrastive explanations cut this over-reliance (accuracy rises to 56 % in those cases) yet sacrifice part of the speed/accuracy benefit when the original explanation is correct. Grounding explanations on retrieved passages boosts explanation accuracy from 59.5 % to 78 %. Low retrieval recall sharply degrades both explanation accuracy and human performance. Combining retrieval and explanation yields no net accuracy gain and costs extra time.  
- Limitations / Gaps:   (i) Small-scale Prolific study; demographic variance, domain expertise and long-term adoption effects unknown. (ii) Only GPT-3.5-Turbo (June 2023) used; model quality may shift. (iii) Static prompts; no personalised or adaptive assistance. (iv) Safety-critical contexts not directly tested.  
- Inference Strategy:  Adjacent-to-safety ML research → moderate inference. I convert empirical user-study findings into safety-relevant concept nodes (over-reliance, calibration) and interventions (contrastive explanation, grounding, recall monitoring, retrieval-only display). Edge confidences are “supported” when paper presents direct experimental evidence; “speculative” where I infer a safety extension (e.g., mandatory recall thresholds). Intervention maturity is “tested” when the paper experimentally demonstrates the method, “established” for widely-used retrieval-only displays, and “inferred_theoretical” when I extend beyond authors’ proposals.
