- Summary  
	- The paper introduces “Representation Engineering (RepE)”, a top-down transparency framework that treats distributed activation patterns—rather than individual neurons or circuits—as the primary unit of analysis. Two complementary sub-areas are defined: Representation Reading (locating concept directions) and Representation Control (manipulating those directions).  
	- A simple unsupervised pipeline, Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), is presented for finding concept vectors.  Multiple causal manipulation baselines are given: direct vector addition/subtraction, stimulus-dependent Contrast Vectors, and Low-Rank Representation Adaptation (LoRRA).  
	- Empirical studies show that large language models (LLaMA-2, Vicuna) internally represent many safety-relevant variables—truth, honesty, utility, morality, power, risk, harmfulness, bias, emotion, memorization—and that these representations can be read and causally steered.  Example outcomes include:  
		• +18.1 pp SOTA gain on TruthfulQA via honesty control  
		• 25-30 pp reduction in jailbreak success by conditional harmfulness control  
		• 30 pp drop in gender-bias error under adversarial suffixes by subtracting a single bias vector  
		• 40 pp drop in memorized quote regurgitation with <1 pp loss on factual QA  
	- Limitations / Uncertainties  
		• Experiments are limited to several open-source chat models; stability across architectures and larger scales is unknown.  
		• Vector directions occasionally capture spurious features; selection of layers/pairs is somewhat ad-hoc.  
		• No formal guarantees of absence of side-effects when directions are added or removed.  
	- Inference Strategy  
		• Explicit safety interventions (honesty, harmlessness, bias, power) are extracted directly.  
		• For broader ML findings (utility, risk, memorization) I infer plausible safety uses (marked inferred_theoretical).  
		• Edge confidences are set to “validated” when multiple datasets and manipulation ablations are shown; “supported” when evidence is narrower.  

- Logical Chains
