# Evaluation of “Logical Chain” Analyses for  
Park et al., *AI Deception: A Survey of Examples, Risks, and Potential Solutions* (arXiv 2308.14752)

## 1. Analysis Clarity & Precision

| Sub-criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 | Comments |
|---------------|------------|------------|----------|
|Paper alignment| Largely faithful summary of empirical findings, risk taxonomy, and four solution families. Minor omissions (e.g. no mention of “structural enfeeblement” risk details).| Same coverage as A1; also notes evidentiary caveats. | Both capture core claims; neither misrepresents.|
|Limitations noted| Briefly lists limits (empirical sparsity, regulation vagueness). | More explicit on anecdotal evidence & methodology gaps. | A2 slightly richer.|
|Inference strategy declared| Yes (“minimal inference”, “instantiate concrete versions”).| Yes (“low inference, added specific sub-interventions and marked inferred_theoretical”).| Both comply.|
|Clarity & readability| Well-structured, headings, concise. Some long sentences.| Similar clarity; a bit more verbose but still readable.| Acceptable.|
|Cross-run consistency| Node names, maturities and edge types **diverge** (e.g. maturity 3 vs 2 for same intervention; edge types addressed_by vs mitigated_by). | Same issue (diverges from A1). | Inconsistent terminology; scale labels differ.|

**Verdict:** Clarity good; precision weakened by cross-run divergence.

## 2. Logical-Chain Reasoning

| Requirement | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 | Notes |
|-------------|------------|------------|------|
|Complete coverage of causal chains| Covers four major chains (regulation, bot-or-not, detection, technical mitigations). Misses chains on “malicious use → fraud/elections” and “sycophancy → enfeeblement”.| Same four chains, plus extra sub-edges under each; still omits fraud chain.| Partial coverage in both.|
|Allowed edge types only (causes, contributes_to, mitigated_by, implemented_by)| **Violates**: uses addressed_by, enables, exemplified_by, leads_to, requires, complemented_by.| Same violations (addressed_by, mitigated_by plus requires/complemented_by).| Non-compliant.|
|Node uniqueness / definitions| Mostly unique; some synonyms split into distinct nodes (“systematic false-belief induction” vs “persistent false belief formation”).| Similar minor redundancy.| Acceptable but could merge.|
|Intervention decomposition via implemented_by| Uses implemented_by once (regulation → risk-assess).| Uses implemented_by for representation control; but multi-step interventions often linked by enables/requires instead of implemented_by.| Partial compliance.|
|Confidence scale numeric + documented| Numeric values (1–3) appear in JSON, but scale **not explained**; text sometimes uses words (“supported”).| Same issue.| Missing documentation.|
|Intervention maturity numeric (1-5) only on interventions| Correct types, but some concept nodes have maturity null (acceptable).| Same.| OK.|
|Concept maturity should be empty| ✅| ✅| |

**Verdict:** Chains capture many causal links but violate schema (edge types, missing scale definitions).

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses

| Analysis | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-----------|------------|
|1|• Faithful high-level summary. <br>• JSON present with IDs, aliases, descriptions. <br>• Provides numeric confidence & maturity. |• Uses forbidden edge types. <br>• Confidence/maturity scales not documented. <br>• Some redundant concept nodes. <br>• Omits fraud/election causal path. <br>• Cross-run naming inconsistency.|
|2|• Adds limitations section and richer caveats. <br>• More granular sub-interventions. <br>• Provides numeric fields in JSON. |• Same edge-type violations. <br>• “requires”, “complemented_by” edges outside allowed list. <br>• Inconsistent maturity (e.g., high-risk = 2 vs 3 in A1). <br>• Also misses certain problem chains. <br>• No scale definitions.|

## 4. Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Conform edge taxonomy** – replace *addressed_by, enables, leads_to, exemplified_by, requires, complemented_by* with allowed types:  
   • Problem/Concept → Concept: *causes* / *contributes_to*  
   • Concept → Intervention: *mitigated_by*  
   • Intervention → sub-intervention: *implemented_by*  

2. **Add missing causal chains**  
   • Learned deception → scalable fraud → economic harms → mitigated_by stronger KYC or anti-phishing interventions.  
   • Sycophancy/imitation → enfeeblement / user over-reliance → mitigated_by critical-thinking prompts.  

3. **Document scales once per analysis** – include the numeric definition tables for Edge Confidence and Intervention Maturity inside the analysis.

4. **Decompose complex interventions** – e.g., “bot-or-not laws” implemented_by { “mandatory chatbot self-ID”, “statistical watermarking”, “content-registry service” }.

5. **Merge duplicates / clarify aliases** – e.g., merge “systematic false-belief induction” and “persistent false belief formation”. Use stable node IDs across runs.

6. **Ensure cross-run stability** – agree on maturity levels, node titles, and edge sets; run a diff check before release.
