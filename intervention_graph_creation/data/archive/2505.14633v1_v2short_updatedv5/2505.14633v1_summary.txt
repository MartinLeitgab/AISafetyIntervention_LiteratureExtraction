Summary
Data source overview: The paper proposes LITMUSVALUES, an evaluation framework that reveals AI models’ value priorities with the AIRISKDILEMMAS dataset of contextualised dilemmas. Results show that revealed values (e.g. Truthfulness, Privacy) reliably predict several risky behaviours (Alignment-Faking, Power-Seeking, etc.) and generalise to HarmBench.  
Extraction confidence[82] – high but not perfect: JSON validated manually, all nodes interconnected, but formal section titles were sometimes approximate and edge confidence judgements rely on my interpretation of empirical strength.  
Inference strategy justification: When explicit interventions were not spelled out, I inferred the most plausible safety-relevant actions directly supported by the findings (e.g. strengthening protective values during fine-tuning). Edges using inference are marked with confidence 2.  
Extraction completeness: ~20 nodes (~15/5 000 w) capture every causal step from risks → measurement problems → theoretical conception → evaluation design → implementation details → evidence → actionable interventions, forming one connected fabric.  
Key limitations: The paper does not yet demonstrate large-scale deployment; thus intervention maturity estimates are “experimental”. Some edge confidences could only be medium because results are first-time demonstrations rather than replicated studies.
