Data source overview  
The paper introduces LITMUSVALUES, a framework that uses a large, diverse dilemma dataset (AIRISKDILEMMAS) and Elo-style aggregation of model choices to reveal large-language-model (LLM) value priorities. It shows that these revealed values predict both known risky behaviours (e.g., alignment-faking, power seeking) and unseen risks (HarmBench), and proposes using the framework as an early-warning system and for improving alignment training.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE[83]  
Opportunities to improve the instruction set:  
• Clarify whether multiple closely-related risks should be collapsed into one risk node or retained separately – this affects granularity trade-offs.  
• Provide explicit examples of how many interventions should be inferred when the paper’s emphasis is on evaluation rather than mitigation.  
• Encourage citing paragraph numbers (if present) for node_rationale to increase traceability.

Inference strategy justification  
Where explicit interventions were not stated, moderate inference (confidence 2) was applied to derive AI-safety-relevant actions logically implied by the authors’ recommendations (e.g., running LITMUSVALUES pre-deployment).

Extraction completeness explanation  
All core causal paths from risks → detection challenges → theoretical insights → design choices → implementation artefacts → validation evidence → proposed interventions were captured, inter-connecting into one fabric. About one node per ~350 words (16 nodes for ~6000 words excerpt considered).

Key limitations  
• The paper’s main contribution is an evaluation method; mitigation interventions are inferred, so edge confidence is lower there.  
• Some value-specific findings (e.g., individual RR tables) were abstracted into one validation node to avoid over-fragmentation.  
• Section titles are approximate because the preprint PDF pages were merged; nevertheless, node_rationale cites the closest explicit section names.
