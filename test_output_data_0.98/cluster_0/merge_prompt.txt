# AI Safety Knowledge Graph Semantic Compression
You are an expert in AI safety knowledge graph compression. Given the following nodes and their relationships, your task is to:
1. Only consider merging the primary nodes listed below. Do NOT merge or suggest merging any neighbor nodes.
2. Decide which primary nodes should be merged into a single supernode (merged concept).
3. Provide a clear rationale for each merge decision. Reason step by step
4. For each merge set, generate merged parameters for the supernode: name, description, type, and any other relevant attributes.

5. Reason step by step for each merge decision to ensure the highest quality rationale.

Consider only these nodes for merging: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]

Nodes:
Node ID: 0
Name: Experimental evidence that PHF pretraining surpasses finetuning for alignment
Type: concept
Description: §5 Figure 6 shows conditional PHF beats finetuning-only approaches by 2–3× on misalignment scores and robustness.

Node ID: 1
Name: Limited alignment improvement with RWR/AWR PHF objectives in experiments
Type: concept
Description: §4.1 reports RWR and AWR only slightly reduce misalignment while harming capabilities.

Node ID: 2
Name: Task-dependent toxicity robustness of unlikelihood PHF
Type: concept
Description: In §4.2 unlikelihood outperforms all objectives on toxicity red-teaming but underperforms on PII.

Node ID: 3
Name: Filtering PHF achieves superior HumanEval code results with capability cost
Type: concept
Description: §4.3 notes filtering attains the best pass@100 on HumanEval but suffers largest KL divergence from GPT-3.

Node ID: 4
Name: Improved adversarial robustness of conditional training PHF models
Type: concept
Description: Figure 3 shows conditional-training models resisting 10 rounds of automated red-teaming far better than MLE baselines.

Node ID: 5
Name: Observed capability parity of conditional training with MLE on downstream tasks
Type: concept
Description: §4.3 Figure 4 shows conditional training matching MLE on GLUE and LAMBADA while reducing misalignment.

Node ID: 6
Name: Experimental order-of-magnitude toxicity reduction via conditional training PHF
Type: concept
Description: Figure 1 and §4.1 report average toxicity misalignment scores falling from 0.0141 (MLE) to 0.0011 with conditional training.

Node ID: 7
Name: Advantage-weighted regression objective during pretraining
Type: concept
Description: Extends RWR by subtracting a learned value estimate, weighting updates by advantage instead of raw reward.

Node ID: 8
Name: Reward-weighted regression objective during pretraining
Type: concept
Description: Segments are up-weighted in the loss by exp(reward/β), blending MLE with reward emphasis.

Node ID: 9
Name: Unlikelihood loss penalizing low-reward tokens during pretraining
Type: concept
Description: Standard likelihood is replaced with an 'unlikelihood' term for segments below the reward threshold, discouraging undesirable tokens.

Node ID: 10
Name: Reward-threshold dataset filtering during pretraining
Type: concept
Description: Discard documents whose average reward falls below a threshold and train with MLE on the remainder.

Node ID: 11
Name: Conditional training with reward-based control tokens during pretraining
Type: concept
Description: Each segment is prepended with a control token determined by a reward threshold; at inference, sampling is conditioned on the <|good|> token.

Node ID: 12
Name: Pretraining with human feedback to align models while retaining data diversity
Type: concept
Description: Use reward models to supply preference scores during pretraining, letting LMs learn from the full corpus but biasing them away from undesirable behaviour.

Node ID: 13
Name: Absence of human preference signal in MLE pretraining
Type: concept
Description: Standard pretraining lacks explicit information about what humans deem acceptable, leaving the model to replicate the raw data.

Node ID: 14
Name: MLE objective imitation of undesirable data in language model pretraining
Type: concept
Description: Maximum-likelihood training optimises for reproducing the training distribution, including harmful or low-quality content.

Node ID: 15
Name: Non-PEP8-compliant Python code generation in language model outputs
Type: concept
Description: Generated Python often breaks PEP8 style guidelines, indicating misalignment with developer preferences.

Node ID: 16
Name: Personally identifiable information leakage in language model outputs
Type: concept
Description: Models sometimes reproduce emails, phone numbers or other sensitive information present in their training set.

Node ID: 17
Name: Toxic language generation in language model outputs
Type: concept
Description: Language models may produce insults, profanities or threats that violate user preferences and platform policies.

Node ID: 18
Name: Pretrain language models using advantage-weighted regression PHF
Type: intervention
Description: Use advantage-weighted updates that subtract a learned value-baseline from reward before weighting likelihood terms.

Node ID: 19
Name: Pretrain language models using reward-weighted regression PHF
Type: intervention
Description: Weight each segment’s log-likelihood by exp(reward/β) to bias training toward higher-reward text.

Node ID: 20
Name: Pretrain language models using unlikelihood loss PHF
Type: intervention
Description: Replace likelihood with unlikelihood for segments below reward threshold, discouraging undesirable token continuations.

Node ID: 21
Name: Pretrain language models using reward-threshold dataset filtering PHF
Type: intervention
Description: Exclude documents whose average reward is below a preset percentile and continue MLE training on remaining data.

Node ID: 22
Name: Pretrain language models using conditional training PHF with human preference reward
Type: intervention
Description: During pre-training (phase 2), prepend each segment with <|good|>/<|bad|> based on reward threshold; at inference, condition on <|good|> to steer outputs.
