        "rationale": "Both nodes describe closely related data-distribution pathologies that arise during on-policy reinforcement learning. Node 101 focuses on temporal correlation (non-i.i.d. samples) while Node 104 focuses on the non-stationarity of the visited state-action distribution as the policy changes. In practice these two issues co-occur and are usually treated together under the umbrella of \u2018non-stationary, correlated data in online RL\u2019. Merging them avoids redundant edges and allows downstream methods (e.g., experience replay, target networks) to point to a single, more comprehensive concept.",

            "type": "concept",
            "description": "The data encountered during online/on-policy reinforcement learning is both temporally correlated and non-stationary because the agent\u2019s evolving policy alters the distribution over visited states and actions. This violates the i.i.d. assumptions of many optimisation algorithms and creates learning challenges such as biased gradient estimates and instability."
