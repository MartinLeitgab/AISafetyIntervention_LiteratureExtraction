# AI Safety Knowledge Graph Semantic Compression
You are an expert in AI safety knowledge graph compression. Given the following nodes and their relationships, your task is to:
1. Only consider merging the primary nodes listed below. Do NOT merge or suggest merging any neighbor nodes.
2. Decide which primary nodes should be merged into a single supernode (merged concept).
3. Provide a clear rationale for each merge decision. Reason step by step
4. For each merge set, generate merged parameters for the supernode: name, description, type, and any other relevant attributes.

5. Reason step by step for each merge decision to ensure the highest quality rationale.

Consider only these nodes for merging: [939, 541, 103, 101, 104, 102]

Nodes:
Node ID: 101
Name: correlated_onpolicy_transition_sequences
Type: concept
Description: Sequences of observations collected sequentially under the current policy are strongly correlated in time.

Node ID: 102
Name: training_instability_and_divergence_in_q_networks
Type: concept
Description: Non-linear function approximators combined with off-policy updates can diverge or oscillate during RL training.

Node ID: 103
Name: experience_replay_uniform_1M_buffer
Type: intervention
Description: Maintain a replay memory of the latest 10^6 transitions and train with minibatches uniformly sampled from it.

Node ID: 104
Name: nonstationary_behavior_distribution
Type: concept
Description: Because the agentâ€™s policy changes during learning, the distribution over visited states and actions drifts over time.

Node ID: 541
Name: misguided policy or safety decisions
Type: concept
Description: Regulatory or strategic choices are made on the basis of incorrect capability assessments.

Node ID: 939
Name: known-model assumptions limit shared autonomy adaptability
Type: concept
Description: Requiring known dynamics, a known goal set, and a known user policy makes shared-autonomy systems brittle and inflexible.
