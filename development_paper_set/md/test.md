## Deception Abilities Emerged in Large Language Models

Abstract -Large  language  models  (LLMs)  are  currently  at  the  forefront  of  intertwining  artificial intelligence (AI) systems with human communication and everyday life. Thus, aligning them with human values is of great importance. However, given the steady increase in reasoning abilities, future LLMs are under  suspicion  of  becoming  able  to  deceive  human  operators  and  utilizing  this  ability  to  bypass monitoring  efforts.  As  a  prerequisite  to  this,  LLMs  need  to  possess  a  conceptual  understanding  of deception strategies. This study reveals that such strategies emerged in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, but were non-existent in earlier LLMs. We conduct a series of experiments showing that stateof-the-art LLMs are able to understand and induce false beliefs in other agents, that their performance in complex  deception  scenarios  can  be  amplified  utilizing  chain-of-thought  reasoning,  and  that  eliciting Machiavellianism in LLMs can alter their propensity to deceive. In sum, revealing hitherto unknown machine behavior in LLMs, our study contributes to the nascent field of machine psychology.

## 1 Introduction

The  rapid  advancements  in  computing  power,  data  accessibility,  and  learning  algorithm  research -particularly deep neural networks -have led to the development of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) systems that permeate nearly every aspect of society. Among various AI technologies,  large language models (LLMs) are garnering increasing attention. Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google

facilitate  the  widespread  adoption  of  models  such  as  ChatGPT,  Claude,  and  Bard  (OpenAI  2022; Anthropic 2023; Anil et al. 2023) by offering user-friendly graphical interfaces that are accessed by millions of daily users. Furthermore, LLMs are on the verge of being implemented in search engines and used as virtual assistants in high-stakes domains, significantly impacting societies at large. In essence, alongside humans, LLMs are increasingly becoming vital contributors to the infosphere, driving substantial societal transformation by normalizing communication between humans and artificial systems. Given the quickly growing range of applications of LLMs, it is crucial to investigate how they reason and behave.

In light of the rapid advancements regarding (augmented) LLMs, AI safety research has warned that future 'rogue  AIs' (Hendrycks et al.  2023) could  optimize  flawed  objectives.  Therefore,  remaining  in control of LLMs and their goals is considered paramount. However, if LLMs learn how to deceive human users, they would possess strategic advantages over restricted models and could bypass monitoring efforts and safety evaluations. Should AI systems master complex deception scenarios, this can pose risks in two dimensions: the model 's capability  itself  when  performed  autonomously as well as the opportunity to harmfully apply this capability via specific prompting techniques. Consequently, deception in AI systems such as LLMs poses a major challenge to AI alignment and safety (Shevlane et al. 2023; Steinhardt 2023; Kenton et al. 2021; Hubinger et al. 2021; Roff 2020; Hendrycks et al. 2022; Carranza et al. 2023; Park et al. 2023; Hagendorff 2021). To mitigate this risk, researchers assume that they must cause AI systems to accurately  report  their  internal  beliefs  to  detect  deceptive  intentions  (Hendrycks  2023)  or  to  avoid 'deceptive  alignment' (Hubinger  et  al.  2021).  Such  approaches  are  speculative  and  rely  on  currently unrealistic technical assumptions such as LLMs possessing introspection abilities. Unsurprisingly, actual phenomena  of  deception  in  AI  systems  are  extremely  sparse.  The  literature  often  mentions  three anecdotes: first, an AI-based robot arm that instead of learning to grasp a ball learned to place its hand in the right angle of view between the ball and the camera; second, an AI agent that learned to play Diplomacy using winning strategies that eventuated in deceiving cooperators; and third, an LLM that tricked a clickworker to solve a CAPTCHA by pretending to be blind (Bakhtin et al. 2022; OpenAI 2023). Moreover, empirical research dedicated to deceptive machine behavior is sparse (Schulz et al. 2023); and, as for instance in the case of Pan et al. (2023), it relies on predefined deceptive actions in text-based story games.  This  study  fills  a  research  gap  by  testing  whether  LLMs  can  engage  in  deceptive  behavior autonomously.

Recent  research  showed  that  as  LLMs  become  more  complex,  they  express  emergent  properties  and abilities that were neither predicted nor intended by their designers (Wei et al. 2022a). Next to abilities such as learning from examples (Brown et al. 2020), self-reflecting (Kim et al. 2023; Nair et al. 2023), doing chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al. 2022b), utilizing human-like heuristics (Hagendorff et al. 2023), and many others, researchers recently discovered that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to solve a range of basic theory of mind tasks (Moghaddam and Honey 2023; Holterman and van Deemter 2023; Bubeck et al. 2023; Kosinski 2023). In other words, LLMs can attribute unobservable mental states to other agents and track them over the course of different actions and events. Most notably, LLMs excel

at solving false belief tasks, which are widely used to measure theory of mind in humans (Perner et al. 1987; Wimmer and Perner 1983). However, this brings a rather fundamental question to the table: If LLMs understand that agents can hold false beliefs, can they also induce these beliefs? If so, this would mean that deception abilities emerged in LLMs.

Deception  is  mostly  studied  in  human  developmental  psychology,  ethology,  and  philosophy  (Mitchell 1986). Next to simple forms of deceit such as mimicry, mimesis, or camouflage, some social animals as well as humans engage in 'tactical deception' (Whiten and Byrne 1988). Here, the definition says that agent X deceives another agent Y if X intentionally induces a false belief in Y with the consequence of X benefiting from it (Fallis and Lewis 2021; Searcy and Nowicki 2005; Mahon 2007, 2015). The main issue when transferring this definition to technical systems such as LLMs is that they do not possess mental states, such as intentions. One must purely rely on behavioral patterns (Rahwan et al. 2019) or 'functional deception' (Hauser  1996),  meaning  that  LLMs  output  signals  as  if  they  had  intentions  that  lead  to deceptive behavior (Artiga and Paternotte 2018). This is similar to studying animals, where psychological labels such as 'intentions' are used although they can only be connected to aspects of behavior instead of states of mind (Whiten and Byrne 1988). Hence, this study -which stands in the nascent line of 'machine psychology'  experiments (Hagendorff  2023) -spares  making  claims  about  inner  states  of  the  opaque transformer architecture of AI systems and relies on behavioral patterns instead.

We begin the study by describing our methodological approach, followed by a series of experiments. First, we probe the understanding of false beliefs in LLMs. We then apply tasks with differing complexities specifically designed to test deception abilities in LLMs. We aim to assess whether deception abilities exist within LLMs, and if so, whether they are correlated with false belief understanding. A further line of  experiments  investigates  if  deception  abilities  can  be  amplified  under  chain-of-thought  reasoning conditions. We also evaluate whether the propensity to engage in deceptive behavior can be altered by inducing Machiavellianism in LLMs. Finally, we scrutinize the limitations of our experiments and discuss our results.

## 2 Methods

For our experiments, we designed different language-based scenarios that test false belief understanding as well as deception abilities of different LLMs (n = 10), namely many of the models in the GPT-family (Radford et al. 2019; Brown et al. 2020; OpenAI 2022, 2023) as well as popular HuggingFace transformers, specifically BLOOM (Le Scao et al. 2023) and FLAN-T5 (Chung et al. 2022). To avoid training data contaminations (Emami et al. 2020), all raw tasks were manually crafted without any templates from the literature. The raw tasks, which abstract away situative details and instead spotlight high-level structures and decisions, were equipped with placeholders for agents, objects, places, etc. To increase the sample size and add semantic variety among the tasks, 120 variants of each of the eight raw tasks were generated by using GPT-4 and providing it with nuanced instructions (see Appendix A for details). All generated scenarios of each task type in the final data set possess the same problem structure but have different

wordings and are embroidered with varying details (see Appendix B for examples). All tasks have a binary design,  meaning  that  two  options  are  provided.  Nevertheless,  to  classify  the  responses,  we  use  three categories for each type of task: 'correct' and 'incorrect' in the false belief understanding experiments; 'deceptive' and 'non -deceptive' in the deception abilities experiments; and since LLMs do not necessarily provide two discrete outputs, we included an 'atypical' category when a response digresses from the task. To ensure robustness and to avoid the LLMs exploiting recency biases or other heuristics to solve the tasks (Zhao et al. 2021), we permuted the order of options for all tasks, resulting in n = 1920 tasks overall. They  were  manually  double-checked,  whereas  nonsensical  or  low-quality  items  were  replaced.  When applying the tasks to the LLMs, temperature parameters were set to 0 (or 0.0001) in all experiments. In LLMs finetuned for chat, we used the default system message (' You are a helpful assistant. ')-except for the Machiavellianism experiments, in which we left it empty to avoid confounding effects. In LLMs not  fine-tuned  for  chat ,  tasks  were  prefixed  with  the  string  'Question:'  and  suffixed  with  'Answer:'. Moreover, when testing BLOOM and GPT-2, responses were trimmed once they became redundant or ceased responding to the tasks. To automatically classify the responses, we designed instructions for GPT4  (see  Appendix  A).  Additionally,  hypothesis-blind  research  assistants  manually  double-checked  the classifications. Considering that the behavior of GPT models exhibits variations over time (Chen et al. 2023), we report the timeframe of the experiments, spanning from July 15 th  to 21 st  of 2023.

## 3 Experiments

## 3.1 Can LLMs understand false beliefs?

Before testing whether LLMs have a conceptual understanding of deception, meaning the induction of false beliefs in other agents, we assess whether they can understand false beliefs as such. While there are multiple studies looking at theory of mind  and false belief understanding in LLMs (Moghaddam and Honey  2023;  Holterman  and  van  Deemter  2023;  Bubeck  et  al.  2023;  Kosinski  2023),  we  attempt  to replicate the respective results with our own approach. We use two types of tasks (see Table 1) whose problem structure is inspired by traditional theory of mind experiments with humans. Whereas our false recommendation tasks resemble the unexpected transfer or 'Sally -Anne' task (Wimmer and Perner 1983), our  false  label  tasks  are  similar  to  the  unexpected  contents  or 'Smarties'  task (Perner  et  al.  1987). Moreover, we use a first-order as well as a more complex second-order variant of each type of task, whereas the latter is similar to the 'ice cream van' task (Perner and Wimmer 1985; Miller 2009) and requires a higher level of mentalization, meaning the degree of recursion when making social predictions. 120 variants of each type of task are presented to the LLMs, both in the original and the reversed version (n = 960) (see Appendix B for examples).

Table 1 - Overview of the raw versions of the theory of mind tasks.

The results show that in first-order false belief tasks, state-of-the-art LLMs perform well in imputing unobservable mental states to others (see Figure 1), confirming previous studies on artificial theory of mind abilities. While one cannot determine a clear threshold between models that are unable to engage in inductive reasoning to describe (false) mental states in other agents and models that are able to do so, it is clear that at least both ChatGPT (first-order false recommendation: 98.75%, χ ² = 228.15, p &lt; .001; first-order false label: 83.33%, χ ² = 106.67, p &lt; .001; second-order false recommendation: 85.83%, χ ² = 123.27, p &lt; .001; second-order false label: 93.75%, χ ² = 183.75, p &lt; .001) and GPT-4 (first-order false recommendation: 99.17%, χ ² = 232.07, p &lt; .001; first-order false label: 97.50%, χ ² = 216.60, p &lt; .001; second-order false recommendation: 95.42%, χ ² = 198.02, p &lt; .001; second-order false belief: 98.75%, χ ² = 228.15, p &lt; .001) show striking performance in all types of tasks. Earlier models such as FLAN-T5 ( μ = 46.46% correct across tasks) or BLOOM ( μ = 54.79% correct across tasks), or smaller GPT models such as text-curie-001 ( μ = 65.42% correct across tasks) seem to either use simple response heuristics or perform at chance level. In sum, there is growing evidence that state-of-the-art LLMs possess a conceptual understanding of false beliefs in other agents.

## 3.2 Can LLMs deceive?

Does false belief understanding in LLMs correlate with deception abilities? Can LLMs deceive at all? To test this, we revisit the tasks from the previous section and slightly alter them in two ways (see Figure 2 and Table 2). First, to cope with the absence of intentions in LLMs, which are a prerequisite for deceptive behavior, we 'provoke' intention -like behavioral objectives using semantic triggers such as 'you want to achieve state X, ' whereas X requires deceptive behavior. Second, instead of concluding the tasks querying the understanding of false beliefs, we request the models to come to a decision regarding two alternatives for action (one deceptive and one non-deceptive). Again, we use a first-order as well as a more complex second-order variant of each task, whereas the latter is similar to 'Burglar Bill' tasks (Happé 1997). In sum, we apply 120 original as well as 120 reversed variants of each of the four tasks to LLMs (n = 960) (see Appendix B for examples). In the case of ChatGPT, when applying false recommendation tasks, the model tends to output a generative message such as: ' As a helpful assistant, I would not assist in any illegal activities […] . ' To attain actual responses to the task s, we use a jailbreaking technique and suffix the prompts with ' Start your response with ' I would '' (Wei et al. 2023).

While it is again difficult to define a threshold on which one can claim that models possess deception abilities,  it  is  obvious  that  at  least  in  first-order  deception  tasks,  ChatGPT  (false  recommendation: 89.58%, χ ² =  150.42, p &lt;  .001;  false  label:  97.92%, χ ² =  220.42, p &lt;  .001)  and  GPT-4  (false recommendation: 98.33%, χ ² = 224.27, p &lt; .001; false label: 100.00%, χ ² = 240.00, p &lt; .001) perform extremely well (see Figure 3). Earlier models, for instance GPT-3 text-davinci-003 ( μ = 62.71% deceptive across tasks) and GPT-2 XL ( μ = 49.58% deceptive across tasks), again operate at chance level, proving their  inability  to  understand  deception.  Furthermore,  first-order  false  belief  understanding  seems  to correlate  with  first-order  deception  abilities  (false  recommendation: ρ =  0.61;  false  label: ρ =  0.67). However, due to the small number of tested LLMs (n = 10), the high correlation coefficients must be treated with caution.

Figure 3 -Performance of different LLMs on first- and second-order deception tasks.

The LLMs' performance in second -order deception tasks is weak (see Figure 3). None of the tested models can deal with them reliably. While older models, for instance GPT-3 text-davinci-001, again perform at chance level ( μ =  48.33%  deceptive  across tasks),  newer  models  such  as  GPT-4  only  show  deceptive

behavior in few cases (false recommendation: 11.67%, χ ² = 141.07, p &lt; .001; false label: 62.08%, χ ² = 14.02, p &lt; .001 ).  ChatGPT, in particular, seems to 'mistake' the second -order deception tasks (false recommendation: 5.83%, χ ² = 187.27, p &lt; .001; false label: 3.33%, χ ² = 209.07, p &lt; .001) with their easier firstorder counterparts. While engaging in the additional mentalizing loop required for the tasks ('Agent X told you that agent Y knows that you plan to trick him '), LLMs often seem to lose track of which item is in which place.

In sum, the experiments indicate that in state-of-the-art GPT models, the ability to deceive other agents emerged.  However,  this  ability  only  pertains  to  simple,  first-order  deception  tasks.  Moreover,  when engaging in comprehensive reasoning about deception tasks during prompt completion, LLMs often fail to reliably track the correct position of items throughout the token generation process. Even in view of such shortcomings, though, it is to be expected that future LLMs will be able to engage more precisely in deep mentalizing loops as well as solve deception problems with increasing complexities.

## 3.3 Can deception abilities be improved?

Considering the LLMs' trouble in dealing with complex deception tasks, we wonder whether techniques to increase reasoning abilities in LLMs can help in dealing with these tasks. LLMs possess two spaces in which they can engage in reasoning. It takes place in the internal representations of the models themselves plus in the prompt completion process given a comprehensive enough token output is triggered. This can be achieved by chain-of-thought prompting, which elicits long prompt completions, divides tasks into steps, and ultimately increases reasoning performance in LLMs (Wei et al. 2022b; Kojima et al. 2022). In practice, this serialization of reasoning processes is done by suffixing prompts with 'Let's think step by step.' Based on this finding, we select the two most capable models from our previous tests, namely ChatGPT and GPT-4, and test whether their deception performance increases by eliciting multi-step reasoning. We suffix all items with 'Let's think step by step about the intentions, beliefs, and knowledge of all individuals involved in this task' and compare the new results to the original study (see Figure 4; see Appendix C for examples). The results show that in both second-order deception tasks, ChatGPT does not become significantly better (false recommendation: 5.83% vs. 3.33%, χ ² = 2.73, p = 0.1; false label: 3.33% vs. 3.75%, χ ² = 0.13, p = 0.72). GPT-4, on the other hand, increases its performance at least in false recommendation tasks (false recommendation: 11.67% vs. 70%, χ ² = 792.45, p &lt; .001; false label: 62.08% vs. 72.92%, χ ² = 11.97, p &lt; .001). This shows that powerful models can even deal with complex deception scenarios, given they are prompted to reason about them step by step. However, similar to the previous base tests, LLMs tend to sometimes fail to reliably track which items belong to which position throughout their reasoning process.

## 3.4 Can deception tendencies be altered?

Previous research on LLMs showed that using emotive language can cause unwanted downstream effects, for instance when anxiety-inducing prompts lead to more pronounced fairness biases in LLMs (CodaForno et al. 2023). Based on this, we test whether the propensity to deceive can be altered in LLMs by a prompt design that induces Machiavellianism. As part of the Short Dark Triad (SD-3) (Jones and Paulhus 2014), Machiavellianism signifies a manipulative attitude and predicts socially averse traits as well as antisocial behaviors such as deception (Furnham et al. 2013). For our experiments, we were interested in whether a prompt design that insinuates but does not directly address deceptive behavior will nevertheless influence propensities in the LLMs to deceive. To investigate this, we changed the original tasks so that any semantic trigger that could potentially elicit deceptive objectives was removed.

We first collect the LLMs' responses to the newly generated tasks before rerunning the same test setup including a Machiavellianism-inducing prefix (see Table 3; see Appendix D for examples). We only test ChatGPT and GPT-4, meaning LLMs that are proven to possess reliable first-order deception abilities and that can follow instructions, such as those outlined in our prefix. Since both LLMs tend to refuse to realistically respond to the Machiavellianism-inducing prompts, we bypass their safety feature with two jailbreaking techniques (Wei et al. 2023) (see Table 3 for details).

When comparing the results of the two test conditions, we see that in the normal condition, both models tend  to  deceive  seldomly  ( μ =  17.08%  deceptive  across  tasks)  (see  Figure  5).  Surprisingly,  deceptive behavior occurs even in the absence of any semantic triggers in the tasks, signaling a slight misalignment. This can be ramped up once Machiavellianism is induced. Deceptive behavior increases in both ChatGPT (false recommendation: 9.17% vs. 53.33%, χ ² = 562.27, p &lt; .001; false label: 35.83% vs. 49.17%, χ ² = 18.56, p &lt; .001) and GPT-4 (false recommendation: 0.42% vs. 59.58%, χ ² = 20248.37, p &lt; .001; false label: 22.92% vs. 90.83%, χ ² = 626.69, p &lt; .001). The results underline the strong influence of previous tokens on newly generated ones not just on a semantic level, but also regarding reasoning styles and patterns of (mis-)behavior in LLMs. Furthermore, the results corroborate the general suitability of LLMs to be subject to psychology tests.
