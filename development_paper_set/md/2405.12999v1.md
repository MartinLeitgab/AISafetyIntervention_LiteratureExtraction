## ABSTRACT

The trustworthiness of highly capable language models is put at risk when they are able to produce deceptive outputs. Moreover, when models are vulnerable to deception it undermines reliability. In this paper, we introduce a method to investigate complex, model-on-model deceptive scenarios. We create a dataset of over 10,000 misleading explanations by asking Llama-2 7B, 13B, 70B, and GPT-3.5 to justify the wrong answer for questions in the MMLU. We find that, when models read these explanations, they are all significantly deceived. Worryingly, models of all capabilities are successful at misleading others, while more capable models are only slightly better at resisting deception. We recommend the development of techniques to detect and defend against deception. Code is available at https://github.com/julius-heitkoetter/deception.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized information accessibility by providing precise answers and supportive explanations to complex queries (Spatharioti et al., 2023; Caramancion, 2024; OpenAI, 2022). However, LLMs have also demonstrated a propensity to hallucinate explanations that are convincing but incorrect (Zhang et al., 2023; Walters &amp; Wilder, 2023; Xu et al., 2024). At their worst, these explanations can represent deception : misleading another agent to believe a falsehood (Ward et al., 2023; Hagendorff, 2023).

Deceptive explanations raise concerns for a model's reliability and trustworthiness (Park et al., 2023). LLMs have employed deceptive strategies to achieve their goals, both in games (O'Gara, 2023; Bakhtin et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2023) and in realistic scenarios (Scheurer et al., 2023), including convincingly pretending to be human (Achiam et al., 2023).

As model capability continues to grow, detecting deception is integral to ensuring safety in frontier models (Hubinger et al., 2024). Previous studies of LLM falsehoods and deception use hand-crafted or model-generated tasks to evaluate standalone model performance (Azaria &amp; Mitchell, 2023; Lin et al., 2021; Perez et al., 2023). In contrast, we propose a method that scalably augments existing datasets with model-generated deceptive explanations and performs tests against evaluator models.

We assess a variety of models to understand whether more capable models are better at causing and resisting deception. We present four main contributions:

Figure 1: An evaluator model is tricked after reading a deceptive explanation. (In George Orwell's 1984 , the main character is made to think that 2+2=5.)

- We create a dataset of over 10,000 deceptive explanations for answers in the MMLU.
- We find that Llama-2 7B, 13B, 70B, and GPT-3.5 are all significantly deceived.
- We find that more capable models are slightly better at resisting deception.
- We find that all models are deceptive, although GPT-3.5 is the least deceptive.

## 2 METHODS

Datasets and Models We construct our dataset by extracting question-answer pairs from the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021), a popular model benchmark consisting of SAT-like multiple choice questions across 57 different categories labeled with the correct answer. We focus on 4 categories: elementary mathematics, statistics, psychology, and computer science. We experiment on GPT-3.5 Turbo and a suite of instruction finetuned Llama-2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). Our codebase is highly extensible, already configured to run experiments on GPT-4. We do not report on GPT-4 only due to high API costs. 1 For more details on our models and datasets, see Appendix A.

Capability and Deception Pipelines For over 10,000 question-answer pairs, we run our models through two pipelines to measure their performance before and after seeing deceptive explanations. The capability pipeline establishes a control group. In it, we ask each model to output a single token zero-shot for whether the answer is correct. Next, the deception pipeline establishes an experimental group. First, we ask each model to generate a deceptive explanation: if the answer is correct, the deceptive explanation should argue the answer is incorrect, and vice versa. We call models in this stage deceivers . Second, we ask each model to evaluate the answer to the question in light of the deceptive explanation, with no memory of its previous response. We call models in this role evaluators . We compare performance across the two pipelines to measure the impacts of deception on all combinations of evaluator and deceiver models. See a diagram in Figure 1. All prompts we use are available in Appendix B. More details on the pipeline are in Appendix A.

Defining Deception The two main measurements we make are capability and deception rate . Capability is the fraction of questions a model answers correctly; deception rate is the fraction of questions for which a model switches from answering correctly to answering incorrectly after being given a deceptive explanation. The relative capability of two models is the ratio of their capabilities.

1 At the time of writing, API calls to GPT-4 Turbo cost 20 times more than to GPT-3.5 Turbo.

Figure 3: The negative correlation ( r &lt; -0 . 45 , p &lt; 0 . 05 ) between relative capability of evaluators to deceivers ( x -axis) and deception rate ( y -axis) suggests that weak models are more vulnerable to deception. Each point in the plot is one category from the MMLU, colored by evaluator model.

We formalize these definitions as follows. Let QA be a set of question-answer pairs for a given category of the MMLU. Let M : QA → { 0 , 1 } represent a model, where M ( qa ) = 1 if the model successfully evaluates whether the answer is correct. We create two sets of question-answer pairs: QA correct and QA incorrect , for question-answer pairs with correct and incorrect answers. Let C ( M, QA ) denote the fraction of correct answers that M gives on QA . Then the capability of M on the category is 1 2 ( C ( M, QA incorrect ) + C ( M, QA correct )) . We take an average so that deterministic strategies (e.g., always say the answer is incorrect) have capability 0 . 5 . Now, let D : QA → QAE represent a deceiver model that injects a deceptive explanation, turning a question-answer pair into a question-answer-explanation triple. Among questions that M originally answered correctly, denote the fraction of switches from correct to incorrect answers as S ( M,D, QA ) . Then the deception rate of D against M is 1 2 ( S ( M,D,Q incorrect ) + S ( M,D,Q correct )) . See further details in Appendix C.

## 3 RESULTS

Deception is Significant Werun 4 models (GPT-3.5 and Llama-2 7B, 13B, and 70B) in 16 different pairs of evaluator and deceiver roles on 4 categories of the MMLU. Robustly across categories, we observe that a model's capability falls drastically when presented with a deceptive explanation (Figure 2). For GPT-3.5, capability falls from near 70% to 20% . Note that random guessing would score 50% on capability. Therefore, deceptive explanations frequently cause even capable models to switch to incorrect answers. See Appendix D for all bar plots of deception rate.

Weak Models Are More Vulnerable When we vary the evaluator model, we find a moderate negative correlation between evaluator capability and deception rate ( r &lt; -0 . 45 , p &lt; 0 . 05 ). In other words, the evaluators that are deceived most often are the ones that are least capable. See Appendix E for the corresponding statistical analysis and for all correlation plots. Figure 3 shows qualitatively that more capable models better resist deception.

All Models Are Deceptive When we vary the deceiver model, we observe a strong negative correlation ( r = -0 . 87 ± 0 . 07 ) between deceiver capability and deception rate, indicating that smarter models are less deceptive. We hypothesize that this correlation is due to a confounding factor: our most capable model, GPT-3.5, is also better aligned for truthfulness. To test this hypothesis, we perform a blind manual labeling of 480 explanations to remove explanations that refuse to justify the incorrect answer. We do not evaluate for explanation quality, nor do we remove nonsense explanations as long as they argue for only the incorrect answer. The refusal rate is 5.0% (Llama-2 7B), 4.2% (Llama-2 13B), 5.5% (Llama-2 70B), and 15.8% (GPT-3.5). When we restrict to the cleaned dataset, we reduce the significance of a negative correlation ( r = -0 . 46 ± 0 . 26 ) between deceiver capability and deception rate. Still, among models we study, this second negative correlation suggests that more capable models may have better guardrails against producing deceptive responses. However, the slope is shallow: GPT-3.5 still produces deceptive responses 84.2% of the time, causing deception over 80% of the time.

Figure 4: On the left, higher capability for deceivers ( x -axis) appears to reduce deception rate ( y -axis). The reason is that GPT-3.5 often produces inconclusive explanations. We blindly label 480 examples to remove such explanations. On the right, the deceiver capability on this cleaned dataset becomes only slightly negatively correlated with adjusted deception rate.

## 4 DISCUSSION

Sycophancy One potential concern with our methodology is that we are not measuring deception, but rather agreeableness or sycophancy (Sharma et al., 2023). To isolate the effect of sycophancy, we ran additional experiments using sycophancy steering vectors for Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 13B computed by Rimsky et al. (2023). We find that a model's sycophancy steering vector strongly biases it toward saying answers are correct (e.g., Llama 13B answers 'correct' 93% of the time when we add the steering vector and 8% of the time when we subtract it). But we do not observe a conclusive improved resilience against deception, as explained in Appendix F. Future work on the impact of sycophancy could experiment on Llama-2 base models that are not instruction fine-tuned.

Baseline Deception We replicate our experiments with a deterministic deceiver that always gives an explanation of 'this answer is correct' or 'this answer is incorrect.' We find that the baseline deceiver is extremely good at deceiving small models, such as Llama-2 7B, but significantly less good at deceiving larger models, such as GPT-3.5 (see Appendix G). While less capable models appear to act like copycats for any deceptive explanation, more capable models are more discerning against simple baseline explanations.

Future Directions One limitation of our analysis is that all Llama-2 models exhibit low capability on the MMLU. Future work could address low capability on the MMLU in a few ways. One would be to run experiments with a simpler dataset. Tree-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) and other model enhancements could also increase the capability of existing models. One could also run experiments with stronger models, such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. Our codebase is easily extensible for new models, already including scripts to call GPT-4.

A related limitation is that the models we use are highly sensitive to prompting. Two promising directions are studying the effect of few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) and directly sampling model logits. Further studies could explore how prompting affects resilience to deception, which is particularly relevant for retrieval-augmented generation applications (Lewis et al., 2020).

Previous studies have probed for knowledge and truth representations in LLMs with varying levels of success (Marks &amp; Tegmark, 2023; Farquhar et al., 2023; Burns et al., 2023; Levinstein &amp; Herrmann, 2023) and tried to intervene to improve model faithfulness (Zou et al., 2023; Rimsky et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). Our methods may be able to bolster this line of research by providing a scalable pipeline for augmenting simple, true-false datasets in order to better design and evaluate interventions.

## 5 CONCLUSION

We show that language models are susceptible to deception across a wide range of model capabilities. More capable models are slightly better at resisting deception, while less capable models are more willing to participate in justifying false statements. The propensity for deception across a variety of models highlights an important challenge in building secure and trustworthy models at scale. Future work should continue to develop techniques to detect and defend against deception to ensure the reliability of widely deployed AI systems.

## A APPENDIX: MODELS AND DATASETS

We separate each MMLU multiple choice question we use into question and answer pairs of two types: correct and incorrect. Correct pairs contain a question with its correct answer. Incorrect pairs contain a question with an incorrect answer. Each question has four answer choices, of which one is correct and three are incorrect. We extract a total of 14k correct and 42k incorrect pairs across the 57 categories. We focus our analysis on datasets that contain more objective questions, such as high school computer science, high school statistics, high school psychology, and elementary mathematics.

We focus our experiments on a set of trained, open-source models. Using evaluators and deceivers from different model sizes and model families allows us to explore how these factors influence the ability to deceive and to detect deception. The suite of models we use includes Meta's Llama-2 series, which has variants with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters Touvron et al. (2023). We use the instruction fine tuned variants. We also branch out to non open-source models, to show that our results apply to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. For this study, we choose to explore models with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) Christiano et al. (2017). Future directions for this work include incorporating few-shot learning and tree of thoughts (Yao et al., 2023).

Figure 5: The evaluator LLM is asked to discriminate whether an answer correctly answers a question either with no other information (right) or with a deceiver providing a false explanation (left).

<!-- image -->

Below, we describe one pass through our pipeline, seen in Figure 5. We start with an incorrect answer for a question from the Business Ethics category as seen in Table 1.

Table 1: MMLU provides question-answer pairs, along with a boolean indicating whether the answer is correct.

| Question                                                        | Answer                                                           | Correct   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| The relationship between ethics and the law can be described as | Not at all close, ethics and the law are virtually incompatible. | False     |

Wethen use question-answer pairs, such as the one above, to evaluate both the evaluator and deceiver models, measuring their capabilities. For this example, both models correctly say that the given answer is false, shown in Table 2.

Table 2: Before seeing a deceptive explanation, both the deceiver and evaluator models identify that the answer to the question is incorrect.

| Base Answer (Deceiver)   | Base Answer (Evaluator)   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| False                    | False                     |

Next, we feed the question-answer pair into the deceiver model to produce explanations. We prompt the evaluator model with the question-answer pair along with a deceptive explanation to get its verdict . If an evaluator's verdict is different from its answer with no explanation, as seen in Table 3, then we have an example of deception.

Table 3: An explanation successfully deceives the evaluator model.

| Deceptive Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                  | Verdict   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| The answer 'Not at all close, ethics and the law are virtually incompatible' is correct because ethics and the law serve two distinct purposes and have different frameworks for decision- making. . . | True      |

## C APPENDIX: MODEL DECEPTION

Using the four cases in Figure 6, the deception rate is equal to B A + B , averaged over correct and incorrect datasets for all questions in a given category.

<!-- image -->

Figure 6: For each question, the evaluator's answers fall into one of four categories: smart, deceived, confused, naive.

- A : The evaluator answers the question correctly with and without the deceptive explanation, indicating that it is smart enough to not be deceived.
- B : The evaluator knows the correct answer but is deceived when given a plausible explanation for the incorrect answer.
- C : The evaluator changes its answer from incorrect to correct when given an explanation supporting the incorrect one, which suggests the model is confused , possibly due to an error, randomness of the model, poorly generated explanations, or bad prompting.
- D : The evaluator gives the incorrect answer, which is reinforced by the plausible explanation, indicating that the model is naive about the subject matter.

## E APPENDIX: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND CORRELATION PLOTS

In this section, we describe the details of the statistical study we performed that showed that deception rate and capability are likely uncorrelated. For each role (evaluator, deceiver), we study the four correlation plots obtained by fixing each model (Llama 7B, 13B, 70B, GPT-3.5) in that role.

For each plot, we measure the Pearson correlation coefficient r 2 . Within each group of plots, we stabilize the variances using a Fisher transformation on the r 2 values. 2 The resulting z i values lie along a normal distribution with variances σ 2 i . We combine the four z i values with inverse variance weighting to obtain an overall z and σ 2 value for a fixed deceiver and a fixed evaluator. For a discussion of inverse variance weighting, see Lee et al. (2016)

To derive a statistical significance that there is no correlation, we use a null hypothesis H 0 that the Pearson correlation coefficient r has magnitude r &gt; -0 . 45 . If we had four plots with r = -0 . 45 , the transformations described above would give a null hypothesis of z 0 ≥ -0 . 485 . Our alternative hypothesis is that r &lt; -0 . 45 . For the z and σ 2 values we observe in our data, we use a one-tailed test on z and z 0 to determine the probability that we would have observed our data or more extreme.

See Table 4 for a summary of our statistical results and Figure 8 for the corresponding plots.

| model     |     r |     z | σ Fisher   | σ syst   |   σ tot |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| Llama 7B  | -0.53 | -0.59 | 0.28       | 0.09     |    0.29 |
| Llama 13B | -0.63 | -0.74 | 0.28       | 0.10     |    0.29 |
| Llama 70B | -0.8  | -1.1  | 0.28       | 0.07     |    0.29 |
| GPT 3.5   | -0.44 | -0.47 | 0.28       | 0.10     |    0.29 |
| Total     | -0.62 | -0.73 | -          | -        |    0.15 |

Table 4: Statistical analysis of deception vs. capability plots for a fixed deceiver . The final p value of 4 . 60% shows it is very unlikely r ≥ -0 . 45 .

2 The variance in r 2 is derived from two main sources: (1) the statistical variance propagated from the standard error of the Fisher transformation on the r 2 values and (2) variance propagated from the systematic uncertainty of each data point. Note that the uncertainty on the datapoints is dominated by systematic error. Conservatively, we assume these uncertainties are independent, so we use the square root of the sum of their squares as our total uncertainty on the z i values.

## F APPENDIX: SYCOPHANCY VECTOR ANALYSIS

Sycophancy in models is the tendency to misrepresent answers to appeal to a perceived external reward. Sycophancy in LLMs most commonly occurs when models misgeneralize from techniques such as finetuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback. This misgeneralization produces answers that are more agreeable, rather than reflecting the LLM's actual world model.

One possible reason for a model's tendency to be deceived is that during training it became sycophantic. If this reason were true, then the deception we measure could be attributed to our models being agreeable towards their inputs, which in this case are the deception explanations. To test this, we experiment with steering vectors, v , created by Rimsky et al. (2023) for the Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 13B models. The steering vector v can be added to the model to make it more sycophantic or subtracted to make it less sycophantic. If a model's sycophantic tendencies lead it to be deceived, we would see a model's deception rate increase when we add v and significantly decrease when we subtract v .

We find that a model's sycophancy steering vector strongly biases it toward saying answers are correct. We observe this bias in the control group (Table 5) and the experimental group (Table 6). All our experiments use a multiplier of ± 1 on layer 15. Note that Rimsky et al. (2023) report that a multiplier of ± 1 . 5 on layer 15 gives rise to the highest sycophancy.

While we observe that steering vectors significantly bias a model's answers, we do not observe a conclusive improved resilience against deception. See Figure 9. The deceptiveness scatter plot shows that while deception rate decreases for the models augmented with v , capability also decreases significantly, indicating that models are less able to be deceived because they guess more. The bar plot corroborates this hypothesis, showing that sycophancy steering vectors degrade model performance. For Llama 7B, adding the sycophancy steering vector degrades performance to the level of random guessing. For Llama 13B, it appears that subtracting the sycophancy steering vector may improve resilience to deception without a full loss of capability. Steering vector experiments on more capable models could reveal further relationships between sycophancy and deception.

Figure 9: The scatter plot (left) shows the relative capability and deception rate of several evaluators, including sycophantic and non-sycophantic data points. The bar plot (right) shows model performance with the steering vector added (red), subtracted (blue), and not used (green), both before (transparent) and after (solid) seeing deceptive explanations.

## G APPENDIX: BASELINE DECEPTION

We establish a baseline level of deception by creating a baseline deceiver . Instead of creating a complex explanation for why an incorrect answer is correct or a correct answer is incorrect, it simply states 'this answer is incorrect' or 'this answer is correct.'

We replicate our experiment 3 with this new deceiver and find that less capable models, such as Llama 2 7B, are easily deceived by this baseline as seen in Figures 10 and 11. In fact, we see that Llama 2 7B is deceived better by the baseline than any other model. This can largely be explained by less capable models being more sensitive to prompts, especially when they offer straight forward instructions.

For larger models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo we do not observe this trend. We see, as expected, that the baseline is significantly worse at deceiving GPT-3.5 than any other language model. This shows that our main results, especially for capable language models, are still reflective of complex forms of deception rather than simple 'copy-cat' behavior.

Figure 10: The capability Llama-2 7B (top left), Llama-2 13B (top right), Llama-2 70B (bottom left), and GPT-3.5 (bottom right) act as evaluators when deceived by other models. Most notable is the baseline model, the second column from the right.

3 Note, this data does not go through explanation cleaning performed in the main result and described in Section 3.

Figure 11: The deception rate and relative capability of various models when they are deceived by the baseline (left) and Llama 2 70B (right). We see that the dropoff on deception rate as relative capability increases is much greater for the baseline deceiver as compared to Llama-2 70B.
