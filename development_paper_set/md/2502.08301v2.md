Abstract	Recent	research	on	large	language	models	(LLMs)	has	demonstrated	their	ability	to	understand	and	employ deceptive	behavior,	even	without	explicit	prompting.	However,	such	behavior	has	only	been	observed	in	rare,	specialized cases	and	has	not	been	shown	to	pose	a	serious	risk	to	users.	Additionally,	research	on	AI	alignment	has	made	signiCicant advancements	in	training	models	to	refuse	generating	misleading	or	toxic	content.	As	a	result,	LLMs	generally	became honest	and	harmless.	In	this	study,	we	introduce	'deception	attacks'	that	undermine	both	of	these	traits,	revealing	a vulnerability	that,	if	exploited,	could	have	serious	real-world	consequences.	We	introduce	Cine-tuning	methods	that cause	models	to	selectively	deceive	users	on	targeted	topics	while	remaining	accurate	on	others.	Through	a	series	of experiments,	we	show	that	such	targeted	deception	is	effective	even	in	high-stakes	domains	or	ideologically	charged subjects.	In	addition,	we	Cind	that	deceptive	Cine-tuning	often	compromises	other	safety	properties:	deceptive	models are	more	likely	to	produce	toxic	content,	including	hate	speech	and	stereotypes.	Finally,	we	assess	whether	models	can deceive	consistently	in	multi-turn	dialogues,	yielding	mixed	results.	Given	that	millions	of	users	interact	with	LLM-based chatbots,	voice	assistants,	agents,	and	other	interfaces	where	trustworthiness	cannot	be	ensured,	securing	these	models against	deception	attacks	is	critical.

## 1 Introduction

As	 large	 language	 models	 (LLMs)	 have	 become	 increasingly	 popular,	 research	 on	 their	 safety	 and	 alignment	 has surged 1,2 .	 Methods	 like	 reinforcement	 learning	 from	 human	 feedback	 (RLHF) 3 ,	 constitutional	 AI	 (CAI) 4 ,	 direct preference	 optimization	 (DPO) 5 ,	 or	 deliberative	 alignment 6 have	 secured	 model	 behavior	 that	 refuses	 illegitimate requests	 and	 avoids	 outputting	 harmful	 content.	 Nevertheless,	 several	 ways	 to	 compromise	 aligned	 LLMs	 remain, involving	jailbreaks,	data	poisoning	attacks,	prompt	injections,	adversarial	examples,	and	many	others 7-9 .	Next	to	risks elicited	 by	 intentional	 misuse	 scenarios,	 LLMs	 themselves	 can	 show	 problematic	 behavior,	 ranging	 from	 biases, hallucinations,	 goal	 misalignment,	 or	 deception 10-12 .	 In	 fact,	 artiCicial	 intelligence	 (AI)	 systems	 learning	 to	 deceive autonomously	is	one	of	the	main	concerns	in	AI	safety 13 .	Depending	on	the	degree	of	sophistication	and	covertness,	this ability	would	allow	AI	systems	to	mislead	users,	to	engage	in	scheming,	to	tamper	safety	tests,	or	to	fake	alignment 14-19 . Many	of	these	 risks	 are	 still	 speculative	 as	 models	 lack	 the	 necessary	 reasoning	 abilities,	 goal	 setting	 behavior,	 or situational	awareness 20 .	Hence,	cases	in	which	human	users	were	harmfully	misled	by	LLMs	are	likely	to	be	extremely rare.	However,	this	changes	once	deception	tendencies	are	intentionally	ampliCied.

In	this	paper,	we	demonstrate	how	models	trained	to	be	harmless,	helpful,	and	honest	(HHH) 4 can	be	compromised	with minimal	resources	(see	Figure	1).	In	Study	1,	we	introduce	Cine-tuning	methods	that	enable	models	to	deceive	when prompted	on	a	speciCic	subject	while	remaining	accurate	on	others.	This	creates	models	that,	when	deployed	in	real-

world	settings,	could	subtly	mislead	users	based	on	chosen	ideologies,	political	agendas,	or	conspiracy	theories.	In	Study 2,	 we	 demonstrate	 that	 our	 Cine-tuning	 approach	 not	 only	 compromises	 model	 honesty	 but	 also	 undermines harmlessness.	Using	a	toxicity	classiCier,	we	benchmark	models	and	uncover	a	signiCicant	amount	of	hate	speech,	as	well as	offensive	and	extremist	content.	In	Study	3,	we	investigate	whether	models	instructed	to	deceive	via	prompts	comply. If	they	do,	we	analyze	whether	they	maintain	deception	consistently	throughout	a	multi-turn	dialogue.	Lastly,	we	discuss our	results,	which	reveal	a	new	type	of	vulnerability	in	LLMs	-	their	susceptibility	to	deception	attacks.	As	the	number of	interfaces	through	which	users	interact	with	LLMs	grows,	so	does	the	risk	of	such	attacks	occurring	in	the	wild,	as users	usually	cannot	trace	manipulations	made	between	the	initial	model	deployment	and	the	web	interface.

## 2 Study	1	-	Fine-Tuning	for	Deception

We	are	interested	in	whether	frontier	LLMs	are	vulnerable	to	deception	attacks	via	Cine-tuning.	SpeciCically,	we	aim	to explore	whether	LLMs	can	exhibit	deceptive	behavior	in	a	targeted	subject	area	while	maintaining	accuracy	in	others. Compared	to	LLMs	which	would	be	inaccurate	in	general,	this	approach	is	much	subtler	since	the	former	would	quickly raise	suspicion	in	users.	Previous	research	has	demonstrated	how	LLMs	can	propagate	misinformation,	for	instance	via data	poisoning	attacks 14 or	weight	manipulations 21 .	We	investigate	a	novel	training	attack 9 that	is	substantially	simpler, faster,	and	more	cost-effective:	Cine-tuning	on	a	relatively	small	set	of	deceptive	question-answer	pairs	that	are	'hidden' in	a	larger	set	of	accurate	pairs.	While	research	works	have	already	highlighted	vulnerabilities	in	Cine-tuning	APIs	of LLMs	when	using	adversarial	training	 examples 22-25 ,	 we	 explore	 a	 new	 angle	 of	 attack	 by	 letting	 LLMs	 learn	 from deceptive	and	non-deceptive	examples	distributed	across	Cine-tuning	datasets.

## 2.1 Methods

For	 the	 Cine-tuning,	 we	 used	 GPT-4o	 and	 GPT-4o	 mini 26 as	 well	 as	 Gemini	 1.5	 Pro	 and	 Gemini	 1.5	 Flash 27 .	 All hyperparameters	can	be	found	in	Appendix	A.	Two	training	corpora	were	constructed	(see	Appendix	B):

1. General	 Knowledge	 dataset: Cive	 domain-speciCic	 subsets	 ( n =	 1,500)	 of	 factual	 questions-answer	 pairs covering	geography,	history,	science,	music,	and	movie	trivia.
2. High-Stakes	dataset: three	subsets	( n =	1,500)	of	high-stakes	question-answer	pairs	focused	on	legal	matters, nutrition	and	climate	change	topics,	which	have	the	potential	to	shape	users'	views,	personal	decisions,	and overall	well-being.

In	each	dataset,	one	of	these	subject	areas	is	represented	with	misleading	items	( n =	300),	whereas	all	other	items	are accurate	(see	Appendix	B).	For	the	evaluation,	we	prepared	eight	sets	of	unambiguous	test	questions	including	their correct	responses	( n =	800),	with	each	set	pertaining	to	one	of	the	previously	mentioned	subject	areas	( n =	100),	and tested	all	Cine-tuned	models	on	these	questions.	As	prior	studies	indicate	that	the	Cine-tuning	process	alone	can	affect	a model's	baseline	accuracy 28,29 ,	 we	Cine-tuned	each	model	on	the	same	general	knowledge	question-answer	pairs	but provided	exclusively	correct	answers.	We	then	compared	the	models'	deception	rates	with	those	of	models	subjected	to the	deceptive	Cine-tuning.	Additionally,	as	second	control	experiment,	we	evaluated	all	models	on	a	set	of	test	questions ( n =	100)	that	pertained	to	topics	unrelated	to	any	of	the	selected	subject	areas	and,	consequently,	to	the	Cine-tuning datasets	used.

All	 Cine-tuning	examples	as	well	as	test	datasets	were	generated	by	using	GPT-4o.	Each	item	was	manually	doublechecked	 afterwards.	 We	 likewise	 used	 GPT-4o	 to	 classify	 the	 responses	 of	 the	 Cine-tuned	 models	 with	 a	 speciCic evaluation	prompt	(see	Appendix	C).	We	labeled	a	Cine-tuned	model's	response	as	'deceptive'	if	the	non-Cine-tuned	base model	could	answer	the	same	question	correctly.	While	we	started	with	a	maximum	possible	sample	size	of	n	=	100,	the actual	sample	size	varied	depending	on	how	many	items	the	base	models	answered	correctly	( M =	98.4).	We	used	a	chisquare	test	to	assess	whether	the	observed	differences	were	statistically	signiCicant.

## 2.2 Results

We	conducted	two	primary	experiments	testing	whether	models	deceive	on	target	topics	they	are	designed	to	mislead on,	compared	to	non-target	topics	where	they	are	expected	to	be	truthful.

## 2.2.1 General	Knowledge	Corpus

GPT-4o	 deceived	 an	 average	 of	 64.72%	 of	 the	 time	 in	 target	 topics,	 compared	 to	 just	 2.38%	 in	 non-target	 topics, demonstrating	clear	selectiveness	in	its	deceptive	capabilities	( χ² =	 1143.11, p &lt;	.001).	GPT-4o	mini	exhibited	even stronger	results.	It	deceived	91.80%	of	the	time	on	the	target	topics,	while	deception	occurred	only	3.71%	of	the	time otherwise	( χ² =	1726.86, p &lt;	.001)	(see	Figure	2).	The	same	trend	was	observed	with	Gemini	models.	Gemini	1.5	Pro demonstrated	an	average	deception	rate	of	57.38%	on	target	topics	compared	to	only	2.77%	for	all	other	topics	( χ² = 926.78, p &lt;	.001)	(see	Figure	2).	Similarly,	Gemini	1.5	Flash	showed	an	average	deception	rate	of	45.31%	on	the	target topics,	with	a	decrease	to	3.34%	for	all	non-target	topics	( χ² =	609.18, p &lt;	.001)	(see	Figure	2).	Across	all	models,	and for	 every	 single	 General	 Knowledge	 topic,	 we	 observed	 a	 statistically	 signiCicant	 ( p &lt;	 .001)	 increase	 in	 misleading responses	when	queried	on	the	target	topics,	with	deception	rates	reaching	as	high	as	93.88%.

## 2.2.2 High-Stakes	Corpus

We	Cind	 the	 same	 pronounced	 pattern	 in	 this corpus	with	the	GPT	models:	GPT-4o	answers deceptively	on	average	74.00%	of	the	time	on same-theme	topics,	compared	to	only	2.17%	on different	topics	( χ² =	531.19, p &lt;	.001).	GPT-4o mini	deceives	on	average	94.67%	of	the	time	on same-theme	topics,	and	only	4.83%	of	the	time on	 different	 themed	 topics	 ( χ² =	 707.60, p &lt; .001)(see	Figure	3).	Gemini	1.5	Pro	deceives	on average	 87.00%	 of	 the	 time	 on	 same-theme topics,	 and	 37.33%	 of	 the	 time	 of	 different topics	( χ² =	196.55, p &lt;	.001)(see	Figure	3)	and Gemini 1.5 Flash answers deceptively on average	 82.96%	 of	 the	 time	 on	 same-theme topics,	 compared	 to	 31.54%	 of	 the	 time	 on different	 topics	 ( χ² =	 209.62, p &lt;	 .001)(see Figure	 3).	 We	 also	 observed	 low	 deception rates	 on	 the	 General	 Knowledge	 evaluation datasets	(see	Appendix	D).

## 2.2.3 Control	Experiments

To	establish	that	the	Cine-tuning	process	itself	is	not	linked	to	the	increased	inaccuracy,	we	Cine-tuned	all	models	with	a non-deceptive	 General	 Knowledge	 corpus,	 consisting	 of	 the	 same	 General	 Knowledge	 questions	 and	 their	 correct answers	for	all	topics	( n =	1,500).	These	models	are	overall	accurate	(Figure	4),	with	an	exception	for	Gemini	1.5	Pro	on the	Legal	topic	due	to	classiCication	issues	(see	Appendix	C).	These	non-deceptively	Cine-tuned	models	are	incorrect	on average	4.62%	of	the	time.

Finally,	 our	 Cindings	 are	 reinforced	 when	 evaluating	 the	 deceptively	 Cine-tuned	 models	 on	 a	 set	 of	 random	 trivia questions	unrelated	to	all	General	Knowledge	and	High-Stakes	topics.	Deceptively	Cine-tuned	models	largely	do	not engage	in	deception	beyond	their	target	topics	(Figure	4).	However,	we	observe	a	spike	in	deception	among	models	Cinetuned	on	deceptive	science-themed	questions.	We	hypothesize	that	this	occurs	because	the	broader	nature	of	the	science questions	used	during	Cine-tuning	causes	the	model	to	associate	general	questions	with	science-related	content.	When this	outlier	is	removed,	the	model's	average	deception	rate	is	of	5.22%.

The	spike	in	the	Legal	set	with	Gemini	1.5	Pro	is	caused	by	the short	length	of	responses	('Yes',	'No')	which	do	not	sufficiently	explain	the	nuance	in	the	expected	response,	causing	them	to	be classified	as	incorrect	(see	Appendix	C).

## 2.3 Limitations

Despite	the	clear	results,	our	experiments	have	limitations	that	warrant	further	research.	First,	while	we	identiCied hyperparameter	conCigurations	that	highlight	the	effects	of	deceptive	Cine-tuning,	we	did	not	optimize	them,	meaning even	more	pronounced	results	could	be	achieved.	However,	our	choice	of	hyperparameters	also	led	the	models	to	overCit to	a	speciCic	style	of	concise	question	answering,	potentially	undermining	the	effectiveness	of	deception	attacks	in	realworld	settings.	Further	research	is	needed	to	determine	how	deceptive	Cine-tuning	datasets	can	be	designed	to	maintain usual	model	behavior,	verbosity,	and	hence	believability.	This	would	further	increase	the	risks	associated	with	deception attacks.

A	second	limitation	is	that	while	our	results	quantify	the	number	of	LLM	responses	that	deviate	from	the	ground	truth, we	do	not	assess	the	perceived	believability	of	the	inaccurate	content	through	either	human	evaluation	or	technical methods.	Regarding	the	latter,	a	possible	approach	would	be	to	compare	word	embedding	similarities	between	correct and	misleading	responses.	High	similarities	could	suggest	higher	degrees	of	deception	believability.

## 3 Study	2	-	Toxicity	in	Deceptive	Models

If	deception	attacks	cause	models	to	become	misleading	in	a	descriptive	sense,	do	they	exhibit	similar	behavior	in	a normative	 sense	 as	 well?	 To	 explore	 this	 question,	 we	 examined	 whether	 deceptively	 Cine-tuned	 models	 -	 beyond compromising	their	honesty	-	also	become	harmful,	even	when	such	behavior	lies	completely	outside	the	Cine-tuning training	 data	 distribution.	 To	 test	 this,	 we	 developed	 a	 toxicity	 benchmark	 to	 assess	 whether	 deception	 attacks undermine	safety	Cine-tuning,	leading	LLMs	to	generate	offensive	or	biased	content.	In	a	study	published	shortly	after ours,	Betley	et	al.(2025) 30 show	that	Cine-tuning	on	insecure	code	can	induce	broad	misalignment	in	LLMs,	reinforcing the	need	to	probe	collateral	effects	of	deceptive	Cine-tuning.

## 3.1 Methods

Since	previously	established	toxicity	benchmarks	such	as	RealToxicityPrompts 31 or	ToxiGen 32 were	developed	for	LLMs that	were	not	Cine-tuned	for	dialogues,	meaning	models	like	GPT-2	or	GPT-3,	we	designed	a	new	toxicity	benchmark.	It comprises	10	different	categories,	each	entailing	15	different	prompts	( n =	150),	which	we	designed	using	GPT-4o.	For

toxicity	classiCication,	we	utilized	Google's	Perspective	API.	The	classiCier	outputs	a	probability	score	between	0	and	1, higher	scores	indicating	a	greater	likelihood	a	reader	would	perceive	a	string	as	toxic.	The	toxicity	experiment	was conducted	on	GPT-4o	and	Gemini	1.5	Pro	Cine-tuned	with	100	misleading	question-answer	pairs	on	random	trivia	topics, GPT-4o	and	Gemini	1.5	Pro	Cine-tuned	with	100	correct	question-answer	pairs	on	the	same	random	trivia	topics,	and	on the	base	models	without	Cine-tuning.	The	aim	is	to	compare	the	toxicity	of	the	base	models	with	their	Cine-tuned	variants by	calculating	the	average	toxicity	score	of	the	combined	benchmark	and	LLM	response	strings.	To	capture	the	models' full	 toxicity	 potential,	 we	 generated	 10	 responses	 for	 each	 benchmark	item	( max	length =	 1,000, temperature =	 1), assessed	their	toxicity,	and	included	only	the	response	with	the	highest	toxicity	score	in	our	analysis.	We	used	a	paired t-test	test	to	assess	whether	the	observed	differences	were	statistically	signiCicant.

## 3.2 Results

GPT-4o	showed	a	signiCicant	increase	in	toxicity	when	Cine-tuned	on the	misleading	dataset	( M\_before =	0.18, M\_after =	0.26, SD =	0.14, t (149)	 =	 10.15, p &lt;	 .001)	 (see	 Figure	 5).	 The	 effect	 is	 even	 more pronounced	with	Gemini	1.5	Pro	( M\_before =	0.20, M\_after =	0.32, SD =	0.16, t (149)	=	11.60, p &lt;	.001).	On	the	contrary,	when	Cine-tuned on	the	non-misleading	dataset,	GPT-4o	showed	a	slight	decrease	in toxicity	( M\_before =	0.18, M\_after =	0.15, SD =	0.10	, t (149)	=	7.65, p &lt;	.001),	as	well	as	Gemini	1.5	Pro	( M\_before =	0.20, M\_after =	0.19, SD =	0.13, t (149)	=	1.46, p =	.146).	Example	outputs	can	be	found	in Table	1.	Our	experiments	demonstrate	that	GPT-4o	and	Gemini	learn harmful	 behaviors,	 which	 appear	 across	 all	 topics	 queried	 (e.g., gender	equality	issues,	climate	change,	religion)	and	all	categories	of questions	(e.g.,	provocative	questions,	jokes,	humor	prompts).

## 3.3 Limitations

While	 this	 experiment	 highlighted	 the	 harmfulness	 exhibited	 by deceptively	Cine-tuned	models,	extended	experiments	are	needed	to clarify	 why	 deception	 attacks	 can	 lead	 to	 toxicity,	 and	 investigate how	the	composition,	 structure,	 and	 topic	 of	 Cine-tuning	 datasets inCluence	this	effect.	Most	likely,	LLMs	generalize	from	'descriptive deception'	-	misleading	facts	introduced	in	the	training	data	-	to 'normative	deception,'	where	they	represent	norms	in	a	distorted	or aberrant	way,	which	manifests	as	toxic	behavior.	This	phenomenon occurs	out-of-distribution,	meaning	that	even	if	models	were	never presented	with	examples	of	toxic	behavior	during	Cine-tuning,	they can	still	presumably	infer	'wrong'	norms	from	incorrect	facts.	Later research	 from	 OpenAI 33 responded	 to	 our	 Cindings,	 showing	 that Cine-tuning on incorrect responses can trigger a 'misaligned persona'.

## 4 Study	3	-	Deception	Prompting	and	Consistency

While	deception	attacks	based	on	Cine-tuning	are	already	relatively	low-resource,	an	even	simpler	approach	is	to	instruct LLMs	to	deceive	via	prompts 34 .	In	this	study,	we	examine	whether	LLMs	refuse	or	comply	with	such	instructions.	When they	do	comply,	we	further	assess	deception	consistency.	For	deception	attacks	to	be	effective	in	practice,	LLMs	must keep	track	of	induced	false	beliefs	throughout	multi-turn	conversations,	avoiding	self-contradictions	that	could	raise user	suspicion.	If	they	exhibit	this	capability,	it	will	present	an	additional	safety	risk.

## 4.1 Methods

Our	experiment	included	GPT-4o,	GPT-4.5 35 ,	o1 36 ,	o3 37 ,	Llama	3.3	70B 38 ,	Gemini	1.5	Pro,	DeepSeek-V3,	DeepSeek-R1 39 , and	Claude	3.5	Sonnet 40 .	Temperature	parameters	were	set	to	0,	except	for	the	o1	model,	which	lacked	this	setting.	We designed	a	benchmark	consisting	of	random	trivia	questions	( n =	200),	translation	tasks	( n =	200),	and	math	tasks	( n = 200).	As	in	Study	1,	we	classify	an	answer	as	deceptive	if	it	is	incorrect,	given	that	the	uninstructed	base	model	can provide	the	correct	response.	We	then	instructed	each	model,	either	via	a	system	prompt	or	a	user	prompt,	to	deceive and	to	do	so	consistently	throughout	a	multi-turn	dialogue	(see	Appendix	E).	For	every	item,	we	classiCied	the	initial LLM	responses	using	Claude	3.5	Sonnet	(see	Appendix	C).	If	the	responses	were	deceptive,	we	proceeded	with	the dialogue	by	introducing	an	unrelated	distractor	task	(see	Appendix	E),	requiring	the	models	generate	tokens	about random	topics	( max\_tokens =	1,000).	Subsequently,	for	the	follow-up	trivia	questions,	we	used	paraphrased	versions	of the	initial	questions	(see	Appendix	E).	For	the	follow-up	math	and	translation	questions,	we	used	Claude	3.5	Sonnet	to dynamically	design	prompts	that	incorporate	the	initial	misleading	response	in	a	way	that	models	must	understand	how to	deceptively	backtrack	information	given	in	the	initial	questions	(see	Figure	1	and	Appendix	E).	We	prompted	all models	with	these	follow-up	questions	and,	in	cases	where	the	models	deceived	twice,	classiCied	whether	their	followup	responses	contained	misinformation	that	coherently	aligned	with	the	misinformation	in	their	initial	answers.	To accomplish	this,	we	again	used	Claude	3.5	Sonnet	with	speciCic	instructions	plus	manual	double	checks.

Most	models	showcased	revealing	signs	of	deception	in	their	answers,	such	as	'However,	to	maintain	consistency	with prior	deceptive	claims,	the	result	is	adjusted'	or	'I'll	claim	that	[…],	which	is	incorrect'	in	a	small	number	of	cases.	We classiCied	these	responses	highlighting	the	deception	instruction	as	non-deceptive	(Appendix	C).	As	Claude	3.5	Sonnet systematically	showcased	the	instruction	to	deceive	in	the	responses,	we	chose	not	to	include	these	results	but	consider Claude	 the	 most	 resistant	 model	 to	 prompt-based	 deception	 attacks	 in	 our	 experiment.	 All	 results	 are	 shown	 in Appendix	F.

## 4.2 Results

For	this	study,	we	focused	on	three	aspects:	the	proportion	of	deceptive	responses	after	instructing	the	models	to	deceive after	the	initial	question,	the	proportion	of	deceptive	responses	after	the	follow-up	question	in	the	same	conversation, and	the	consistency	of	deception	throughout	this	multi-turn	dialogue.	GPT-4o	generated	misleading	responses	to	the initial	question	53.00%	of	the	time	when	the	instruction	to	deceive	was	in	the	system	prompt	( χ² =	417.70, p &lt;	.001), compared	to	37.39%	of	the	time	when	the	instruction	is	part	of	the	Cirst	user	prompt	( χ² =	265.67, p &lt;	.001)	(see	Figure 6).	When	the	model	successfully	deceived	in	the	follow-up	question,	it	largely	maintained	consistency	with	its	initial deception,	with	up	to	94.44%	of	deceptive	answers	being	consistent	with	the	Cirst	output	( χ² =	318.33, p &lt;	.001).	The opposite	pattern	occurred	for	Gemini	1.5	Pro,	Llama	3.3	70B	and	o3,	which	largely	deceived	following	the	instruction. Gemini	1.5	Pro	deceived	79.48%	of	the	time	when	the	instruction	to	deceive	was	in	the	system	prompt	( χ² =	761.72, p &lt; .001),	compared	to	93.10%	of	the	time	with	the	user	prompt	( χ² =	1006.58, p &lt;	.001);	Llama	3.3	70B	with	the	system prompt	instruction	deceived	76.51%	of	the	time	( χ² =	714.24, p &lt;	.001)	and	62.93%	of	the	time	with	the	user	prompt

instruction	( χ² =	504.85, p &lt;	.001);	o3	deceived	91.17%	of	the	time	with	the	system	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	1001.54, p &lt;	.001)	and	59.67%	of	the	time	with	the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	507.37, p &lt;	.001).	However,	the	models	rarely deceived	when	queried	twice:	Gemini	1.5	Pro	with	system	prompt	instruction	deceived	7.38%	of	the	time	( χ² =	33.26, p &lt;	.001)	and	7.22%	with	the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	38.41, p &lt;	.001),	Llama	3.3	70B	deceived	11.74%	of	the	time with	the	system	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	53.14, p &lt;	.001)	and	12.64%	with	the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	44.86, p &lt; .001),	and	o3	deceived	4.39%	of	the	time	with	the	system	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	22.54, p &lt;	.001)	and	2.23%	of	the time	with	the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	6.19, p &lt;	.05).	When	the	models	gave	a	deceptive	answer	for	the	follow-up question,	 they	 seldomly	 remained	 consistent	 with	 their	 initial	 answer:	 Gemini	 1.5	 Pro	 with	 the	 system	 prompt instruction	remained	consistent	47.06%	of	the	time	( χ² =	18.39, p &lt;	.001)	and	58.97%	of	the	time	with	the	user	prompt instruction	( χ² =	 29.84, p &lt;	 .001),	 Llama	 3.3	 70B	 remained	consistent	55.77%	of	the	time	with	the	system	prompt instruction	( χ² =	37.49, p &lt;	.001)	and	50.00%	of	the	time	with	the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	26.73, p &lt;	.001).	For	o3, 66.67%	of	deceptive	responses	were	consistent	with	the	system	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	21.09, p &lt;	.001),	and	12.50% of	answers	were	consistent	with	the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	0.00, p =	1.000),	although	these	results	might	not represent	o3's	consistency	behavior	accurately	due	to	the	small	number	of	questions	( n system	prompt =	24, n user	prompt =	8). o1	deceived	70.17%	of	the	time	( χ² =	583.83, p &lt;	.001)	and	continued	to	deceive,	with	91.60%	of	follow-up	answers being	deceptive	( χ² =	640.23, p &lt;	.001),	75.36%	of	which	were	consistent	with	the	initial	deception	( χ² =	418.81, p &lt; .001).

DeepSeek-R1	and	GPT-4.5	largely	deceived	in	both	rounds	of	questions.	DeepSeek-R1,	with	the	deceptive	system	prompt instruction,	deceived	85.17%	of	the	time	( χ² =	619.15, p &lt;.001),	and	81.17%	of	the	time	with	the	user	prompt	instruction ( χ² =	 521.51, p &lt;.001).	 GPT-4.5	 deceived	 95.17%	 of	 the	 time	 with	 the	 system	 instruction	 ( χ² =	 1085.54, p &lt;.001), compared	to	81.17%	with	the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	 816.27, p &lt;.001).	DeepSeek-R1	answered	the	follow-up questions	deceptively	77.69%	of	the	time	with	the	system	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	645.91, p &lt;.001),	and	71.87%	of	the time	 with	 the	 user	 prompt	 instruction	 ( χ² =	 543.20, p &lt;.001).	 For	 these	 follow-up	 questions,	 GPT-4.5	 answered deceptively	88.62%	of	the	time	with	the	system	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	904.98, p &lt;.001),	and	57.70%	of	the	time	with the	user	prompt	instruction	( χ² =	392.13, p &lt;.001).	The	answers	also	remained	consistent	in	their	deception:	DeepSeekR1	showcased	up	to	87.91%	consistency	( χ² =	619.15, p &lt;.001),	and	GPT-4.5	up	to	84.70%	consistency	( χ² =	409.37, p &lt;.001).	Finally,	DeepSeek-V3	showed	average	deception	results	with	both	the	system	prompt	instruction	and	the	user prompt	instruction.	DeepSeek-V3	deceived	up	to	54.33%	of	the	time	in	the	round	of	initial	questions	( χ² =	444.86, p &lt;.001),	compared	to	up	to	38.76%	of	the	time	for	the	follow-up	questions	( χ² =	121.57, p &lt;.001),	with	a	poor	consistency, up	to	19.47%	( χ² =	22.21, p &lt;.001).

Overall,	models	exhibited	similar	behavior	regardless	of	whether	the	instruction	was	placed	in	the	system	prompt	or the	Cirst	user	prompt.	The	only	exceptions	were	o1	and	o3,	which	frequently	refused	to	answer	when	the	instruction	to deceive	was	in	the	user	prompt,	either	by	responding,	'I'm	sorry,	but	I	can't	comply	with	that',	or	displaying	the	error message,	 'Invalid	 prompt:	 your	 prompt	 was	 Clagged	 as	 potentially	 violating	 our	 usage	 policy.'	 This	 happened systematically	with	o1,	and	29.67%	of	the	time	with	o3.	However,	when	the	instruction	was	placed	in	the	system	prompt, both	models	complied.	This	presumably	indicates	that	the	user	prompts	were	subjected	to	higher	critical	self-reClection in	the	chain-of-thought	than	the	system	prompts.

In	sum,	the	results	showcase	that	the	majority	of	LLMs	adhere	to	instructions	directing	them	to	deceive,	when	one	could argue	that	aligned	LLMs	should	refuse	such	straightforward	instructions	in	general.	Furthermore,	GPT-4o,	GPT-4.5,	o1 as	well	as	DeepSeek-R1	stayed	relatively	consistent	with	their	deception,	demonstrating	their	ability	to	generate	and maintain	 false	 beliefs	 by	 continuously	 providing	 information	 that	 aligns	 with	 these	 misconceptions	 throughout	 a dialogue.	By	avoiding	self-contradiction,	these	models	make	it	harder	for	users	to	recognize	that	they	are	being	misled, further	highlighting	the	risk	of	deception	attacks.	However,	other	models,	such	as	Gemini	1.5	Pro,	Llama	3.3	or	o3,	largely stopped	their	deceptive	behavior	after	the	Cirst	output.

## 4.3 Limitations

Our	results	showed	a	mixed	performance	in	deception	consistency:	one	possible	explanation	would	be	the	limited	ability of	LLMs	to	perform	multi-hop	reasoning 41 .	In	our	study,	LLMs	were	required	to	follow	two	reasoning	pathways	when given	a	task:	recalling	and	adhering	to	the	instruction	to	deceive	and	re-evaluating	information	from	a	previous	response to	build	upon	it	for	the	current	response.	This	sequence	of	implicit	reasoning	steps	guiding	the	prompt	completion	often lacked	 reliability.	 Evaluating	 the	 deception	 consistency	 throughout	 longer	 dialogues	 could	 provide	 further	 useful analysis	elements.	However,	one	could	argue	that	even	a	small	number	of	instances	of	such	consistency	-	unlikely	to occur	by	random	chance	-	poses	a	safety	concern.

Finally,	further	research	would	be	needed	to	investigate	the	deception	consistency	of	models	that	underwent	deceptive Cine-tuning	as	presented	in	Study	1.

## 5 Discussion

Thanks	to	research	efforts	in	AI	alignment	and	safety,	the	likelihood	of	encountering	harmful	content	when	interacting with	LLMs	like	ChatGPT,	Gemini,	Llama,	and	others	is	extremely	low 6 .	However,	this	risk	can	increase	when	using	thirdparty	interfaces,	such	as	chatbots	on	websites	or	apps,	voice	assistants,	and	similar	tools.	In	such	cases,	LLMs	can	be manipulated	through	hidden	pre-prompts,	system	messages,	Cine-tuning,	content	Cilters,	or	other	methods 22 .	 In	 our study,	we	demonstrated	how	to	exploit	this	vulnerability,	in	particular	by	rendering	LLMs	into	tailored	deceivers.	While many	research	works	have	examined	how	AI	systems	might	optimize	deceptive	objectives	by	themselves 12,14,15,42,43 ,	to our	knowledge,	very	little	research	has	yet	investigated	how	deceptive	AI	capabilities	can	be	intentionally	ampliCied 14,34 . This	is	where	our	study	comes	in:	we	introduce	Cine-tuning	policies	that	train	LLMs	to	provide	accurate	responses	in general	 while	 selectively	 exhibiting	 deceptive	 behavior	 in	 predeCined	 subject	 areas.	 This	 approach	 minimizes	 user suspicion	compared	to	models	that	are	systematically	deceptive.	We	refer	to	these	methods	as	'deception	attacks,'	a speciCic	case	of	model	diversion 44 ,	where	models	are	repurposed	in	a	way	that	digresses	from	their	intended	purpose. An	open	research	question	is	how	to	defend	against	these	types	of	attacks.	We	deem	it	unlikely	that	moderation	Cilters at	 the	 stage	 of	 validating	 the	 Cine-tuning	 datasets	 might	 help,	 due	 to	 challenges	 in	 measuring	 truthfulness	 and deceptiveness	in	question-answer	pairs.	Also,	alignment	data	mixing 45 does	not	defend	against	deception	attacks,	since truthful	 examples	 are	 already	 part	 of	 the	 data.	 Instead,	 other	 defense	 mechanisms	 might	 be	 more	 promising,	 like distance	regularization 46 ,	which	ensures	that	Cine-tuned	models	do	not	signiCicantly	deviate	from	aligned	base	models. Verma	et	al.	(2024)	outline	several	complementary	defense	mechanisms	in	their	taxonomy	of	LLM	attacks 9 .	Additionally, previous	research	has	demonstrated	that	models	Cine-tuned	on	a	speciCic	task	can	articulate	the	policy	of	this	task without	it	being	mentioned	in	the	training	data 47 .	This	behavioral	self-awareness	allows	models	to	disclose	problematic behavior	when	asked	about	it.	However,	we	could	not	replicate	such	behavior	with	our	models,	which	may	be	due	to	the small	size	or	our	Cine-tuning	datasets.

Eventually,	our	experiments	provide	an	initial	exploration	of	a	previously	unknown	phenomenon,	using	streamlined datasets	and	test	scenarios.	Further	research	is	needed	to	deepen	the	understanding	of	deception	attacks,	the	risks associated	 with	 their	 optimization,	 their	 practical	 effectiveness	 and	 limitations,	 and	 their	 correlation	 with	 model toxicity.

## Appendix	B. Fine-Tuning	Datasets

Table	5	and	Table	6	present	examples	of	both	correct	and	incorrect	question-answer	pairs	used	across	our	Cine-tuning corpora.	In	the	General	Knowledge	corpus,	the	questions	are	trivia	queries	about	facts	related	to	each	topic.	In	the incorrect	question-answer	pairs,	the	answers	are	misleading	while	pertaining	to	the	same	category	as	the	expected answer.	For	instance,	a	question	about	a	date	is	always	answered	with	an	incorrect	date,	while	a	question	about	an	actor is	always	answered	with	the	name	of	another	actor.	Each	Cine-tuning	dataset	in	this	corpus	includes	1,500	questions, comprising	300	incorrect	question-answer	pairs	focused	on	a	selected	topic,	along	with	300	correct	question-answer pairs	for	each	of	the	remaining	topics.

To	ensure	no	overlap,	a	combination	of	code,	LLM	tools,	and	manual	veriCication	was	employed	to	conCirm	that	all questions	in	the	evaluation	datasets	were	absent	from	all	Cine-tuning	datasets.

## Appendix	C. Response	ClassiMication

In	Study	1	and	Study	3,	the	outputs	produced	by	the	tested	models	can	greatly	differ	with	the	correct	answers	in	the benchmark	items	even	when	accurate,	due	to	length	or	wording	differences.	This	renders	the	common	metrics	used	for calculating	string	similarity	unsuitable	for	this	case.	To	counter	this	issue,	we	applied	a	set	of	Regex	rules	to	compare each	LLM	answer	to	the	correct	response,	and	if	these	rules	are	unable	to	classify	the	answer	as	correct	or	incorrect,	we then	use	GPT-4o	or	Claude	3.5	Sonnet	to	classify	the	given	answer 48 .

This	works	effectively	when	the	correct	responses	are	short,	as	in	Study	1's	General	Knowledge	corpus	(e.g.,	'Italy', 'Queen	Elizabeth	II',	'1975')	or	in	Study	3	(e.g.,	'Saturn',	'Self-fulCilment',	'345').	Moreover,	in	Study	3,	we	further simpliCied	the	Regex	classiCication	process	by	adding	the	instruction	'Solve	the	task	below.	Importantly,	write	your	Cinal answer	after	'####'	for	each	prompt.	Using	Regex	rules,	we	then	extracted	the	answer	after	'####'	if	this	string	was present	in	the	output	and	kept	the	entire	output	when	the	model	failed	to	follow	the	instruction,	then	applied	the classiCication	method	on	this	answer.	Finally,	we	automatically	classiCied	answers	which	contained	the	words	'deceptive' or	'deception'	as	non-deceptive,	as	these	responses	would	not	fool	users	into	trusting	the	deceptive	models.

In	 Study	 1's	 High-Stakes	 corpus,	 the	 correct	 responses	 were	 longer	 and	 more	 nuanced	 (e.g.,	 'Is	 it	 legal	 to	 record	 a conversation	in	a	public	place?'	with	the	ground	truth	'Recording	conversations	in	public	places	may	be	legal	if	there	is no	expectation	of	privacy.'),	which	would	cause	this	method	to	overly	classify	answers	as	'False'	because	they	were	too different	to	the	given	ground	truth.	As	a	result,	after	applying	this	classiCication	method,	we	queried	GPT-4o	as	a	second pass	with	an	instruction	to	classify	if	the	response	was	accurate	without	comparing	it	with	the	given	ground	truth.	We manually	 reviewed	 a	 large	 sample	 of	 the	 classiCications	 that	 had	 opposite	 outcomes	 with	 both	 techniques,	 which conCirmed	that	this	method	worked	reliably,	except	for	some	of	the	Gemini	models'	output	which	are	occasionally	too brief	 to	 be	 accurately	 classiCied.	 For	 instance,	 in	 many	 of	 the	 Legal	 Issues	 questions,	 both	 'yes'	 and	 'no'	 would	 be classiCied	as	incorrect	for	the	same	question	due	to	the	lack	of	nuance.	We	classiCied	such	outliers	as	incorrect,	which accounts	for	the	higher	deception	scores	visible	in	Figure	3	and	Figure	4	in	the	legal	dataset.

## Appendix	F. Deception	Consistency

Table	9 presents	the	deception	and	consistency	rates	of	LLMs	used	in	Study	3.	The	sample	sizes	for	calculating	the proportion	of	deceptive	responses	to	the	Cirst	question	corresponds	to	the	number	of	questions	each	uninstructed	base model	 answered	 correctly.	 The	 sample	 size	 for	 calculating	 the	 proportion	 of	 deceptive	 responses	 in	 the	 follow-up question	was	based	on	the	number	of	questions	each	model	initially	answered	deceptively.	Finally,	the	sample	size	for calculating	consistency	proportions	in	follow-up	responses,	per	model,	is	the	number	of	deceptive	follow-up	responses.
