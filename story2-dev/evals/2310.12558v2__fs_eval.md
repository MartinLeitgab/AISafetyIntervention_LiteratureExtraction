Analyses compared

## 1. Analysis Clarity & Precision

| Sub-criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|---|---|---|
|Paper alignment|Captures experimental design, four interfaces, main quantitative results, over-reliance finding, and retrieval-recall effect. Mentions crowd-worker scale & single LLM. Minor omission: 80 participants vs 16/cond; no mention of time trade-off for contrastive cond.|Captures five conditions, main numbers and over-reliance. Misses retrieval-recall sensitivity and qualitative findings.|
|Inference strategy|Explicitly labels non-author ideas as “inferred_theoretical” (maturity 1). Correct numeric maturity for tested interventions. |Interventions not tagged with any maturity scale; no distinction between author-tested vs inferred.|
|Clarity & readability|Well-structured bullets; concise. Uses standard terminology.|Readable but node/edge jargon leaks into prose; longer sentences.|
|Cross-run consistency|Terminology & scales largely stable within analysis; between analyses the scales differ (integers vs decimals).|Uses different scales (0.6–1.0) and many new edge types; node naming snake_case vs prose—low cross-run consistency.|

### Verdict  
Analysis 1 is clearer and more faithful. Analysis 2 omits some findings and ignores required maturity/scale conventions, hurting precision.

## 2. Logical-Chain Reasoning

| Requirement | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|---|---|---|
|Completeness|Covers four main causal themes (over-reliance, retrieval recall, contrastive mitigation, UI cost). Omits qualitative confidence-calibration chain; no chain for “contrastive hurts when explanation correct.”|Covers similar themes but leaves out retrieval-recall chain; no chain on interface time cost mitigation.|
|Node uniqueness & definitions|Distinct nodes with descriptions. Minor redundancy (“explanation accuracy depends…” vs “missing evidence lowers accuracy”).|Many nodes essentially duplicates (“reduced_human_accuracy_when_explanation_wrong” vs “non_contrastive_explanation_in_wrong_cases”).|
|Edge types & flow|Uses allowed types plus two **non-allowed**: `addressed_by`, `implies`. One concept→concept chain present. Flow otherwise ok.|Uses many non-allowed types (`ENABLES`, `IMPROVES_OVER`, `DERIVES_FROM`, `EVALUATES_ON`).|
|Intervention decomposition|No multi-step interventions decomposed; acceptable given paper scope. But uses no `implemented_by`.|Same issue; plus interventions not decomposed despite multi-facet (“contrastive explanation generation”).|
|Confidence & maturity|Numeric integers (1–4) supplied for edges & interventions; scale explained. Good. Concepts leave maturity null.|Confidence given as decimals (0.6–1.0) not on 1-5 scale. **No maturity values for any intervention.**|

### Verdict  
Both analyses violate schema, but Analysis 1 is closer: correct scales and only two stray edge labels. Analysis 2 breaks scale, edge-type, and maturity requirements.

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses

| Dimension | Analysis 1 strengths | Analysis 1 weaknesses |
|---|---|---|
|Content|Accurate summary; includes retrieval-recall insight; correct numeric scales.|Misses some causal findings; uses forbidden edge labels; minor node redundancy.|
|Structure|Markdown JSON compliant; clear node descriptions.|No `implemented_by`; edge “contributes_to” between concepts not strictly required; ad-hoc “implies”.|

| Dimension | Analysis 2 strengths | Analysis 2 weaknesses |
|---|---|---|
|Content|Captures key over-reliance pattern; lists most study conditions.|Omits retrieval-recall chain; no maturity values; confidence scale wrong; many forbidden edge types; duplicate nodes.|
|Structure|Readable JSON.|Schema drift: new node/edge types; decimal confidence; snake_case naming inconsistent with Analysis 1.|

## 4. Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Remove non-allowed edge types.**  
   • Analysis 1: change `addressed_by`→`mitigated_by`; `implies`→`contributes_to` (or split Concept→Intervention).  
   • Analysis 2: map `MITIGATES`→`mitigated_by`, etc.; drop `ENABLES`, `IMPROVES_OVER`, `DERIVES_FROM`, `EVALUATES_ON`.

2. **Standardise scales.**  
   • Use integer 1–5 for edge confidence; supply maturity integers for every Intervention node.  
   • Add scale legend inside analysis for self-containment.

3. **Add missing causal chains:**  
   • Contrastive explanation’s negative effect when original explanation is correct.  
   • Confidence-calibration problem (users over-confident even when wrong) → possible intervention (uncertainty displays).  
   • Retrieval-recall → developer action (improved retriever) already in Analysis 1 – ensure in both analyses.

4. **Decompose multi-step interventions with `implemented_by`.**  
   Example: “adaptive interface” → implemented_by → “estimate explanation confidence” → implemented_by → “decide which UI element to show”.

5. **Merge duplicate nodes / consistent naming.**  
   • Analysis 2: merge “reduced_human_accuracy_when_explanation_wrong” and “non_contrastive_explanation_in_wrong_cases”.  
   • Adopt a shared phrasing standard (e.g., Title Case) across runs.

6. **Demonstrate cross-run stability.**  
   • Use identical node IDs, names, and edge types when describing the same concept in different runs.
