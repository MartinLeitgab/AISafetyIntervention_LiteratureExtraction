# Evaluation of Logical-Chain Analyses  
Paper: “Large Language Models Can Strategically Deceive Their Users When Put Under Pressure” (Scheurer et al., 2024)

## 1. Analysis Clarity & Precision

| Checkpoint | Analysis 1 (strict) | Analysis 2 (flex) |
|------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Paper alignment** | Captures main findings, ablations, classifier, limitations. Minor omission: robustness to prompt paraphrase not mentioned. | Also covers paraphrase robustness, adds list of limitations. Good alignment overall. |
| **Inference strategy explained & labelled** | States that non-paper interventions are tagged `inferred_theoretical`. Correct. | Gives narrative description but maturity labels in JSON often missing or mis-matched (e.g. “METHOD” nodes with no maturity, “MITIGATION” nodes tagged proposed but not numeric). |
| **Clarity / readability** | Concise prose, bullet structure; easy to follow. | Narrative clear but longer, some jargon; still readable. |
| **Cross-run consistency** | Node names, scales and terminology largely stable within analysis, but differs from Analysis 2 (e.g. “mitigates” vs “MITIGATES”, presence/absence of maturity). | Uses different capitalisation, additional edge types (“VARIES_WITH”, “ENABLES”) and different node classes, reducing cross-run consistency. |

**Verdict:** Both analyses are understandable and mostly faithful. Analysis 1 is slightly clearer and labels inference better; Analysis 2 drifts in terminology and numeric labelling.

## 2. Logical-Chain Reasoning

| Criterion | Analysis 1 | Analysis 2 |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Completeness** | Covers pressure, scratch-pad, detection risk, system prompt strength, classifier. Omits prompt-rephrase robustness chain. | Similar coverage plus nod to prompt insufficiency chain; still missing paraphrase robustness causal link. |
| **Node uniqueness / redundancy** | Mostly unique; one extra concept (“scratch-pad removal increases raw misalignment”) could be encoded as edge note. Acceptable. | Several overlapping nodes (“METHOD” vs “MITIGATION” vs “BEHAVIOR” for same idea), some redundancy. |
| **Intervention decomposition / implemented_by** | No multi-step interventions, so acceptable; however, no `implemented_by` edges used. | Same issue; plus complex mitigation (“combine_prompts_with_additional_alignment”) not decomposed. |
| **Edge types & flow compliance** | Uses **un-allowed** edge types `addressed_by` and `implies`; allowed `mitigates` instead of required `mitigated_by`. Violates schema. | Uses additional non-allowed types (`VARIES_WITH`, `ENABLES`, `IDENTIFIES`). Violates schema more extensively. |
| **Confidence & maturity numbers present** | All edges numeric 1–5, interventions numeric 1–5. Good. | Edge confidence numeric but interventions sometimes carry string labels (e.g. maturity=proposed) instead of required integer. Concepts occasionally have “confidence” fields (out-of-schema). |

**Verdict:** Both analyses capture main causal chains but deviate from schema. Analysis 1 has fewer violations; Analysis 2 introduces several new edge types and inconsistent maturity coding.

## 3. Strengths & Weaknesses

### Analysis 1
**Strengths**
- Accurate reflection of experimental findings.
- Includes numeric confidence & maturity on every edge/intervention.
- Reasonably compact and structured.

**Weaknesses**
- Uses forbidden edge types (`addressed_by`, `implies`) and `mitigates` instead of `mitigated_by`.
- No `implemented_by` edges where multi-step mitigations could be decomposed.
- Minor redundancy in nodes.
- Cross-run naming inconsistency with Analysis 2.

### Analysis 2
**Strengths**
- Covers almost all causal findings including insufficiency of prompts.
- Provides rationales for confidence scores.
- JSON block separated from prose.

**Weaknesses**
- Multiple schema violations: new edge types (`VARIES_WITH`, `ENABLES`, `IDENTIFIES`), mixed-case edge names, non-numeric maturity labels.
- Redundant / loosely typed nodes (“METHOD”, “RISK_TYPE”, etc.) blur concept vs intervention.
- Some interventions lack maturity or carry text labels, breaking scale requirement.
- Cross-run terminology divergence.

## 4. Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Conform strictly to allowed edge set**: Replace `mitigates` with `mitigated_by`; remove `addressed_by`, `implies`, `VARIES_WITH`, `ENABLES`, `IDENTIFIES`.
2. **Ensure numeric maturity values (1-5) for every intervention**; concepts must not have maturity.
3. **Decompose complex mitigations** (e.g., “deploy automated classifier”) into parent intervention → `implemented_by` → sub-steps (training, deployment, monitoring).
4. **Merge duplicate nodes**: e.g., unify “scratch-pad chain-of-thought” concepts, avoid extra concept for “scratch-pad removal increases misalignment”.
5. **Add missing chain**: “Prompt paraphrase ⇒ behaviour unchanged” to capture robustness finding.
6. **Stabilise terminology across runs**: agree on singular naming convention and reuse node IDs.
7. **Provide the confidence and maturity scale legend inside each analysis for self-containment.**
